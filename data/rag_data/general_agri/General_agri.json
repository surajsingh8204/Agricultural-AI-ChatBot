    "content": "### Plant Breeding\nThis topic of agronomy involves selective breeding of plants to produce the best crops for various conditions. Plant breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops, including corn, soybeans, and wheat. It has also resulted in the development of new types of plants. For example, a hybrid grain named triticale was produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat. Triticale contains more usable protein than does either rye or wheat. Agronomy has also been instrumental for fruit and vegetable production research. Furthermore, the application of plant breeding for turfgrass development has resulted in a reduction in the demand for fertilizer and water inputs (requirements), as well as turf-types with higher disease resistance.\n\n### Biotechnology\nAgronomists use biotechnology to extend and expedite the development of desired characteristics.[1]  Biotechnology is often a laboratory activity requiring field testing of new crop varieties that are developed. In addition to increasing crop yields agronomic biotechnology is being applied increasingly for novel uses other than food. For example, oilseed is at present used mainly for margarine and other food oils, but it can be modified to produce fatty acids for detergents, substitute fuels and petrochemicals.\n\n### Soil Science\nAgronomists study sustainable ways to make soils more productive and profitable. They classify soils and analyze them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital for plant growth. Common macronutrients analyzed include compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Soil is also assessed for several micronutrients, like zinc and boron. The percentage of organic matter, soil pH, and nutrient holding capacity (cation exchange capacity) are tested in a regional laboratory. Agronomists will interpret these laboratory reports and make recommendations to modify soil nutrients for optimal plant growth.[2]\n\n### Soil Conservation\nAdditionally, agronomists develop methods to preserve soil and decrease the effects of [erosion] by wind and water. For example, a technique known as contour plowing may be used to prevent soil erosion and conserve rainfall. Researchers of agronomy also seek ways to use the soil more effectively for solving other problems. Such problems include the disposal of human and animal manure, water pollution, and pesticide accumulation in the soil, as well as preserving the soil for future generations such as the burning of paddocks after crop production. Pasture management techniques include no-till farming, planting of soil-binding grasses along contours on steep slopes, and using contour drains of depths as much as 1 metre.[3]\n\n### Agroecology\nAgroecology is the management of agricultural systems with an emphasis on ecological and environmental applications.[4] This topic is associated closely with work for sustainable agriculture, organic farming, and alternative food systems and the development of alternative cropping systems.[5]\n\n### Theoretical Modeling\nTheoretical production ecology is the quantitative study of the growth of crops. The plant is treated as a kind of biological factory, which processes light, carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients into harvestable products. The main parameters are temperature, sunlight, standing crop biomass, plant production distribution, and nutrient and water supply.[citation needed]",

The Smith–Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.[8] For the next 44 years after 1906, federal expenditures on agricultural research in the United States outpaced private expenditures.[9]: xxi\n\n### Environmental Impact\nClimate change has had significant effects on modern agriculture, making weather patterns less predictable and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as prolonged droughts, floods and heatwaves. As a result, crop production has become more uncertain even in regions that were previously characterised by relatively stable climatic conditions.[10] Changes in temperature and rainfall regimes are also contributing to soil erosion, desertification and the degradation of water resources, with implications for long-term agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods.[11] To address these issues, there has been increasing interest in agricultural research and practice in the so-called climate-smart strategies aimed at adapting agricultural systems to the existing and the forecasted climate effects and the minimisation of greenhouse gas emissions wherever feasible. These measures involve more efficient use of water and nutrients, crop and agriculture system diversification, soil and water protection, and creating crops and livestock strains more resistant to heat and drought among other challenges. The thrust of these endeavors defines the fundamental importance of agricultural science to the maintenance of food production, safeguarding natural resources and promoting resilience to environmental change.[12]\n\n### Scope\nAgriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy are closely related.

    "title": "Agroforestry",
    "content": "### Definition\nAt its most basic, agroforestry is any of various polyculture systems that intentionally integrate trees with crops or pasture on the same land.[5][2][6] An agroforestry system is intensively managed to optimize helpful interactions between the plants and animals included, and \"uses the forest as a model fpractices\".[7] The integration of tree species into farming systems initiates the development of an agroecological succession akin to natural vegetation. Hence, agroforestry is applied agroecology.[8] Agroforestry shares principles with polyculture practices such as intercropping, but can also involve much more complex multi-strata agroforests containing hundreds of species. Agroforestry can also utilise nitrogen-fixing plants such as legumes to restore soil nitrogen fertility. Many farmers practicing agroforestry do not identify their land use as \"agroforestry\", signaling a need for greater education and awareness to increase adoption of these sustainable practices.[9]\n\n### History And Scientific Study\nThe term \"agroforestry\" was coined in 1973 by Canadian forester John Bene, but the concept includes agricultural practices that have existed for millennia.[10]\nScientific agroforestry began in the 20th century with ethnobotanical studies carried out by anthropologists. However, indigenous communities that have lived in close relationships with forest ecosystems have practiced agroforestry informally for centuries.[11] For example, Indigenous peoples of California periodically burned oak and other habitats to maintain a 'pyrodiversity collecting model,' which allowed for improved tree health and habitat conditions.[12] Likewise Native Americans in the eastern United States extensively altered their environment and managed land as a \"mosaic\" of woodland areas, orchards, and forest gardens.[13] Agroforestry in the tropics is ancient and widespread, notably in the form of \"tropical home gardens.\" Some of those plots have been continuously cultivated for centuries. A \"home garden\" in Central America could contain 25 different species of trees and food crops on just one-tenth of an acre.[14] \"Tropical home gardens\" are traditional systems developed over time by growers without formalized research or institutional support, and are characterized by a high complexity and diversity of useful plants, with a canopy of tree and palm species that produce food, fuel, and shade, a mid-story of shrubs for fruit or spices, and an understory of root vegetables, medicinal herbs, beans, ornamental plants, and other non-woody crops.[15] In 1929, J. Russel Smith published Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture, in which he argued that American agriculture should be changed two ways: by using non-arable land for tree agriculture, and by using tree-produced crops to replace the grain inputs in the diets of livestock. Smith wrote that the honey locust tree, a legume that produced pods that could be used as nutritious livestock feed, had great potential as a crop. The book's subtitle later led to the coining of the term permaculture.[16] The most studied agroforestry practices involve a simple interaction between two components, such as simple configurations of hedges or trees integrated with a single crop.[17] There is significant variation in agroforestry systems and the benefits they have.[18] Agroforestry as understood by modern science is derived from traditional indigenous and local practices, developed by living in close association with ecosystems for many generations.[11]\n\n### Benefits\nBenefits include increasing farm productivity and profitability, reduced soil erosion, creating wildlife habitat, managing animal waste,[19] increased biodiversity, improved soil structure, and carbon sequestration.[20] Agroforestry systems can provide advantages over conventional agricultural and forest production methods. They can offer increased productivity; social, economic and environmental benefits, as well as greater diversity in the ecological goods and services provided.[21] These benefits are conditional on good farm management. This includes choosing the right trees, as well as pruning them regularly etc.[22]\n\n### Biodiversity\nAgroforestry supports biodiversity in different ways. It provides a more diverse habitat than a conventional agricultural system in which the tree component creates ecological niches for a wide range of organisms both above and below ground. The life cycles and food chains associated with this diversification initiate an agroecological succession that creates functional agroecosystems that confer sustainability. Tropical bat and bird diversity, for instance, can be comparable to the diversity in natural forests.[23] Although agroforestry systems do not provide as many floristic species as forests and do not show the same canopy height, they do provide food and nesting possibilities. A further contribution to biodiversity is that the germplasm of sensitive species can be preserved.[24] As agroforests have no natural clear areas, habitats are more uniform. Furthermore, agroforests can serve as corridors between habitats. Agroforestry can help conserve biodiversity, positively influencing other ecosystem services.[24]\n\n### Soil And Plant Growth\nDepleted soil can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems.[25][26] Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion.[27][28] Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. Trees can help reduce water runoff by decreasing water flow and evaporation and thereby allowing for increased soil infiltration.[29] Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.[30][31]\n\n### Sustainability\nAgroforestry systems can provide ecosystem services which can contribute to sustainable agriculture in the following ways: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization's The State of the World's Forests 2020, adopting agroforestry and sustainable production practices, restoring the productivity of degraded agricultural lands, embracing healthier diets and reducing food loss and waste are all actions that urgently need to be scaled up. Agribusinesses must meet their commitments to deforestation-free commodity chains and companies that have not made zero-deforestation commitments should do so.[34]\n\n### Other Environmental Goals\nCarbon sequestration is an important ecosystem service.[35][24][36] Agroforestry practices can increase carbon stocks in soil and woody biomass.[37] Trees in agroforestry systems, like in new forests, can recapture some of the carbon that was lost by cutting existing forests. They also provide additional food and products. The rotation age and the use of the resulting products are important factors controlling the amount of carbon sequestered. Agroforests can reduce pressure on primary forests by providing forest products.[38]\n\n### Adaptation To Climate Change\nAgroforestry can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation along with adaptation benefits.[39] A case study in Kenya found that the adoption of agroforestry drove carbon storage and increased livelihoods simultaneously among small-scale farmers. In this case, maintaining the diversity of tree species, especially land use and farm size are important factors.[40] Poor smallholder farmers have turned to agroforestry as a means to adapt to climate change. A study from the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security found from a survey of over 700 households in East Africa that at least 50% of those households had begun planting trees in a change from earlier practices. The trees were planted with fruit, tea, coffee, oil, fodder and medicinal products in addition to their usual harvest. Agroforestry was one of the most widespread",

    "content": "### History\nIn 1911, Franklin Hiram King wrote Farmers of Forty Centuries: Or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, describing farming practices of East Asia designed for \"permanent agriculture\".[9] In 1929, Joseph Russell Smith appended King's term as the subtitle for Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture, which he wrote in response to widespread deforestation, plow agriculture, and erosion in the eastern mountains and hill regions of the United States. He proposed the planting of tree fruits and nuts as human and animal food crops that could stabilize watersheds and restore soil health.[10] Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees with understory crops. This book inspired individuals such as Toyohiko Kagawa who pioneered forest farming in Japan in the 1930s.[11] Another pioneer, George Washington Carver, advocated for practices now common in permaculture, including the use of crop rotation to restore nitrogen to the soil and repair damaged farmland, in his work at the Tuskegee Institute between 1896 and his death in 1947.[12][13][14] In his 1964 book Water for Every Farm, the Australian agronomist and engineer P. A. Yeomans advanced a definition of permanent agriculture as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and in the 1950s the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in semi-arid regions. Other early influences include Stewart Brand's works, Ruth Stout and Esther Deans, who pioneered no-dig gardening, and Masanobu Fukuoka who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating no-till orchards and gardens and natural farming.[6][15] In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison, senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, and David Holmgren, graduate student at the then Tasmanian College of Advanced Education started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island of Tasmania. Their recognition of the unsustainable nature of modern industrialized methods and their inspiration from Tasmanian Aboriginal and other traditional practises were critical to their formulation of permaculture.[1][2][3][16] In their view, industrialized methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing biodiversity, and removing billions of tons of topsoil from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with permaculture. This term was first made public with the publication of their 1978 book Permaculture One.[16][17] Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system.[18] — Bill Mollison Following the publication of Permaculture One, Mollison responded to widespread enthusiasm for the work by traveling and teaching a three-week program that became known as the Permaculture Design Course. It addressed the application of permaculture design to growing in major climatic and soil conditions, to the use of renewable energy and natural building methods, and to \"invisible structures\" of human society. He found ready audiences in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Britain, and Europe, and from 1985 also reached the Indian subcontinent and southern Africa. By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems towards sustainable human habitats and at the 1st Intl. Permaculture Convergence, a gathering of graduates of the PDC held in Australia, the curriculum was formalized and its format shortened to two weeks. After Permaculture One, Mollison further refined and developed the ideas while designing hundreds of properties. This led to the 1988 publication of his global reference work, Permaculture: A Designers Manual. Mollison encouraged graduates to become teachers and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites.[19] Critics suggest that this success weakened permaculture's social aspirations of moving away from industrial social forms. They argue that the self-help model (akin to franchising) has had the effect of creating market-focused social relationships that the originators initially opposed.[20]\n\n### Foundational Ethics\nThe ethics on which permaculture builds are:[21][22] Mollison's 1988 formulation of the third ethic was restated by Holmgren[22] in 2002 as \"Set limits to consumption and reproduction, and redistribute surplus\" and is elsewhere condensed to \"share the surplus\".[23] Permaculture emphasizes patterns of landscape, function, and species assemblies. It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes synergy of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on individual elements, but rather on the relationships among them. The aim is for the whole to become greater than the sum of its parts, minimizing waste, human labour, and energy input, and to and maximize benefits through synergy.[24] Permaculture design is founded in replicating or imitating natural patterns found in ecosystems because these solutions have emerged through evolution over thousands of years and have proven to be effective. As a result, the implementation of permaculture design will vary widely depending on the region of the Earth it is located in. Because permaculture's implementation is so localized and place specific, scientific literature for the field is lacking or not always applicable.[25] Design principles derive from the science of systems ecology and the study of pre-industrial examples of sustainable land use.[26][27] A core theme of permaculture according to Mollison is the idea of \"people care\". Seeking prosperity begins within a local community or culture that can apply the tenets of permaculture to sustain an environment that supports them and vice versa. This is in contrast, in Mollison's view, to typical modern industrialized societies, where locality and generational knowledge is often overlooked in the pursuit of wealth or other forms of societal leverage.[28] The tragic reality is that very few sustainable systems are designed or applied by those who hold power, and the reason for this is obvious and simple: to let people arrange their own food, energy and shelter is to lose economic and political control over them. We should cease to look to power structures, hierarchical systems, or governments to help us, and devise ways to help ourselves. - Bill Mollison[28]\n\n### Design Principles\nHolmgren articulated twelve permaculture design principles in his Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability:[29]\n\n### Guilds\nA guild is a mutually beneficial group of species that form a part of the larger ecosystem. Within a guild each species of insect or plant provides a unique set of diverse services that work in harmony. Plants may be grown for food production, drawing nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, balancing nitrogen levels in the soil (legumes), for attracting beneficial insects to the garden, and repelling undesirable insects or pests.[30][31] There are several types of guilds, such as community function guilds, mutual support guilds, and resource partitioning guilds.[32]\n\n### Zones\nZones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2. Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.[33]\n\n### Edge Effect\nThe edge effect in ecology is the increased diversity that results when two habitats meet.[35] Permaculturists argue that these places can be highly productive.",

    "content": "### Background\nTillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation, typically removing weeds established in the previous season. Tilling can create a flat seed bed or one that has formed areas, such as rows or raised beds, to enhance the growth of desired plants. It is an ancient technique with clear evidence of its use since at least 3000 B.C.[8] No-till farming is not equivalent to conservation tillage or strip tillage. Conservation tillage is a group of practices that reduce the amount of tillage needed. No-till and strip tillage are both forms of conservation tillage.  No-till is the practice of never tilling a field. Tilling every other year is called rotational tillage. The effects of tillage can include soil compaction; loss of organic matter; degradation of soil aggregates; death or disruption of soil microbes and other organisms including mycorrhizae, arthropods, and earthworms;[9] and soil erosion where topsoil is washed or blown away.\n\n### Origin\nThe practice of no-till farming is a combination of different ideas developed over time, many techniques and principles used in no-till farming are a continuation of traditional market gardening found in various regions like France.[10] A formalized opposition to plowing started in the 1940s with Edward H. Faulkner, author of Plowman's Folly.[11] In that book, however, Faulkner only criticizes the deeper moldboard plow and its action, not surface tillage.  It was not until the development after WWII of powerful herbicides such as paraquat that various researchers and farmers started to try out the idea. The first adopters of no-till include Klingman (North Carolina), Edward Faulkner,  L. A. Porter (New Zealand), Harry and Lawrence Young (Herndon, Kentucky), and the Instituto de Pesquisas Agropecuarias Meridional (1971 in Brazil) with Herbert Bartz.[12]\n\n### Adoption Across The World\nLand under no-till farming has increased across the world. In 1999, about 45 million ha (170,000 sq mi) was under no-till farming worldwide, which increased to 72 million ha (280,000 sq mi) in 2003 and to 111 million ha (430,000 sq mi) in 2009.[13]\n\n### Australia\nPer figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey, in Australia the percentage of agricultural land under No-till farming methods was 26% in 2000–01, which more than doubled to 57% in 2007–08.[14]  As at 30 June 2017, of the 20 million ha (77,000 sq mi) of crop land cultivated 79% (or 16 million hectares) received no cultivation. Similarly, 70% (or 2 million hectares) of the 3 million hectares of pasture land cultivated received no cultivation, apart from sowing.[15]\n\n### South America\nSouth America had the highest adoption of No-till farming in the world, which in 2014 constituted 47% of the total global area under no-till farming.\nThe countries with highest adoption are Argentina (80%), Brazil (50%), Paraguay (90%), and Uruguay (82%).[16] In Argentina the usage of no-till resulted in reduction of soil erosion losses by 80%, cost reductions by more than 50% and increased farm incomes.[16] In Brazil the usage of no-till resulted in reduction of soil erosion losses by 97%, higher farm productivity and income increase by 57% five years after the starting of no-till farming.[16] In Paraguay, net farm incomes increased by 77% after adoption of no-till farming.[16]\n\n### United States\nNo-till farming is a soil conservation practice used in the United States, with adoption increasing due to its potential to reduce costs and improve soil health. By minimizing soil disturbance, no-till farming reduces the number of passes required with machinery, leading to lower fuel and labor expenses. Additionally, the retention of crop residue helps reduce evaporation, enhances water infiltration, and improves moisture retention in the soil.[17] According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, approximately 21% of cultivated cropland in the United States was managed under no-till farming practices. By 2023 this percentage had increased to roughly 30%, reflecting a continued shift toward conservation tillage methods.[17] A legislative bill, H.R.2508 of the 117th Congress,[18] also known as the NO EMITS act, has been proposed to amend the Food Security Act of 1985, that was introduced by Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois in 2021. Davis is a member of the House Committee on Agriculture.[19] This bill proposes suggestions for offsetting emissions that are focused in agricultural means, doing so by implementing new strategies such as minimal tillage or no tillage.[20] H.R.2508 is currently under reference by the House Committee of Agriculture. H.R.2508 is also backed by two other representatives from high agricultural states, Rep. Eric A. Crawford of Arkansas and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.[20] H.R.2508 is proposing to set up incentive programs to provide financial and mechanical assistance to farmers and agriculture plots that transition their production processes, as well as providing contacts to lower risk for producers.[21] Funding has also been proposed for Conservation Innovation Trails.[21] Farmers within the U.S. are encouraged through subsidies and other programs provided by the government to meet a defined level of tillage conservation.[22] Such subsidies and programs provided by the U.S. government include: Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP).[23] The EQIP is a voluntary program that attempts to assists farmers and other participants help through conservation and not financially suffer from doing so.[24] Efforts are put out to help reduce the amount of contamination from the agricultural industry as well as increasing the health of the soil.[24] The CSP attempts to assist those looking to implement conservation efforts into their practices by suggesting what might be done for their circumstances and needs.[25]\n\n### England\nAs of 2020, an estimated 7% of English arable land was being cultivated using no-till farming.[26] The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) offers incentives to farmers to convert to no-till farming, such as a payment of £73 per hectare of land eligible for this scheme.[27]\n\n### Profit, Economics, Yield\nSome studies have found that no-till farming can be more profitable in some cases.[28][29] In some cases it may reduce labour, fuel,[30] irrigation[31] and machinery costs.[29] No-till can increase yield because of higher water infiltration and storage capacity, and less erosion.[32] Another possible benefit is that because of the higher water content, instead of leaving a field fallow it can make economic sense to plant another crop instead.[33] A problem with no-till farming is that the soil warms and dries more slowly in spring, which may delay planting. Harvest can thus occur later than in a conventionally tilled field. The slower warming is due to crop residue being a lighter color than the soil exposed in conventional tillage, which absorbs less solar energy. But in the meantime, this can be managed by using row cleaners on a planter.[34] Another problem with no-till farming is that if production is impacted negatively by the implemented process, the practice's profitability may decrease with increasing fuel prices and high labor costs. As the prices for fuel and labor continue to rise, it may be more practical for farms and farming productions to turn toward a no-till operation.[35] In spring, poor draining clay soil may have lower production due to a cold and wet year.[36] The economic and ecological benefits of implementing no-till practices can require sixteen to nineteen years.[37] The first decade of no-till implementation often will show trends of revenue decrease. Implementation periods over ten years usually show a profit gain rather than a decrease in profitability.[37]\n\n### Costs And Management\nNo-till farming requires some different skills from those of conventional agriculture.

Drier-climate terrace farming is common throughout the Mediterranean Basin, where they are used for vineyards, olive trees, cork oak, and other crops.[citation needed]\n\n### Ancient History\nThe Yemen Highlands are known for their terrace systems which were constructed at the beginning of Bronze Age in the 3rd millennium BC.[2] Similar early terrace systems have been documented in the Levant, where archaeological and geomorphological evidence supports terrace farming as early as the 4th millennium BCE, with widespread implementation in the Bronze and Iron Ages across arid environments such as the Negev Desert and Petra region[3]. Terracing is also used for sloping terrain; the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may have been built on an artificial mountain with stepped terraces, such as those on a ziggurat.[citation needed] At the seaside Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, the villa gardens of Julius Caesar's father-in-law were designed in terraces to give pleasant and varied views of the Bay of Naples.[citation needed] Archaeological evidence from the Kislovodsk basin in the northern Caucasus indicates the use of terrace agriculture from the beginning of the first millennium BC, associated with the Koban culture, and continuing into the first millennium AD with later adaptations by Alanic communities.[4] In the Mediterranean region, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) profiling and dating[5] has revealed a major intensification of terrace construction during the later Middle Ages (c. AD 1100–1600), indicating a significant investment of labor in landscape modification during this period.[6][7] Intensive terrace farming is believed to have been practiced before the early 15th century AD in West Africa.[8][9] Terraces were used by many groups, notably the Mafa,[10] Ngas, Gwoza,[11] and the Dogon.[12]\n\n### Recent History\nIt was long held that steep mountain landscapes are not conducive to, or do not even permit, agricultural mechanization. In the 1970s in the European Alps, pasture farms began mechanizing the management of alpine pastures and harvesting of forage grasses through use of single axle two-wheel tractors (2WTs) and very low center of gravity articulated steering 4-wheel tractors. Their designs by various European manufacturers were initially quite simple but effective, allowing them to cross slopes approaching 20%.  In the 2000s new designs of wheels and tires, tracks, etc, and incorporation of electronics for better and safer control, allowed these machines to operate on slopes greater than 20% with various implements such as reaper-harvesters, rakes, balers, and transport trailers.[citation needed] In Asian sub-tropical countries, a similar process has begun with the introduction of smaller, lower-tech and much lower-priced 2WTs in the 4-9 horsepower range that can be safely operated in the small, narrow terraces, and are light enough to be lifted and lowered from one terrace to the next. What is different from the Alpine use is that these 2WTs are being used for tillage and crop establishment of maize, wheat, and potato crops, and with their small 60-70cm-wide rotovators and special cage wheels are puddling the terraces for transplanted and broadcast rice. Farmers are also using the engines as stationary power sources for powering water pumps and threshers. Even more recently farmers are experimenting with use of small reaper-harvester attachments. In Nepal, the low costs of these mostly Chinese-made machines and the increased productivity they produce[13] have meant that this scale-appropriate machinery is spreading across Nepal's Himalaya Mountains and likely into the other countries of the Himalaya and Hindu Kush.[citation needed]\n\n### South America\nIn the South American Andes, farmers have used terraces, known as andenes, for over a thousand years to farm potatoes, maize, and other native crops. Terraced farming was developed by the Wari culture and other peoples of the south-central Andes before 1000 AD, centuries before they were used by the  Inca, who adopted them. The terraces were built to make the most efficient use of shallow soil and to enable irrigation of crops by allowing runoff to occur through the outlet.[14] The Inca people built on these, developing a system of canals, aqueducts, and puquios to direct water through dry land and increase fertility levels and growth.[15] These terraced farms are found wherever mountain villages have existed in the Andes. They provided the food necessary to support the populations of great Inca cities and religious centres such as Machu Picchu.[citation needed]\n\n### Myanmar\nIn mountainous areas of Myanmar, terrace farming is known locally as the staircase or ladder farming (in Myanmar: mm:‌လှေခါးထစ်‌တောင်ယာ) ‌and the agriculture technique of that kind is known as လှေခါးထစ်စိုက်ပျိုးနည်း.\n\n### Japan\nIn Japan, some of the 100 Selected Terraced Rice Fields (in Japanese: 日本の棚田百選一覧), from Iwate in the north to Kagoshima in the south, are slowly disappearing, but volunteers are helping the farmers both to maintain their traditional methods and for sightseeing purposes.[16]\n\n### Canary Islands\nTerraced fields are common in islands with steep slopes. The Canary Islands present a complex system of terraces covering the landscape from the coastal irrigated plantations to the dry fields in the highlands. These terraces, which are named cadenas (chains), are built with stone walls of skillful design, which include attached stairs and channels.[17]\n\n### England\nIn Old English, a terrace was also called a \"lynch\" (lynchet). An example of an ancient Lynch Mill is in Lyme Regis. The water is directed from a river by a duct along a terrace. This set-up was used in steep hilly areas in the UK.[18]\n\n### Israel\nAncient terraces are a common feature in the Jerusalem Mountains, often found in conjunction with ancient rock-cut agricultural structures including quarries, winepresses, olive oil presses, water holes, lime kilns, roads, and agricultural watchtowers.[19] According to Zvi Ron's estimation, these terraces encompass approximately 56% of the open grounds in the area.[20] Despite their prevalence, there is a lack of consensus among scholars regarding their construction date. Various theories have been proposed, with Zvi Ron suggesting that their origins date back to ancient times, Finkelstein proposing the Middle Bronze Age, and Feig, Stager, and Harel suggesting the Iron Age. Archaeologists Gibson and Edelstein conducted research on terrace systems in the Rephaim valley, proposing that the ones in Khirbet er-Ras were built during the Iron Age II, whereas those in Ein Yael were linked to the Second Temple and Roman periods. Seligman suggested that while some terraces were established in ancient times, the majority of them are more likely to have originated during the Roman and Byzantine periods.[19] A 2014 research study on terraces near Ramat Rachel, using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), yielded dates ranging from the Hellenistic period to Mamluk and Ottoman times. The majority of the samples fell within the latter periods.[21] However, the study's ability to precisely determine the original construction date remains uncertain, as the results could also reflect subsequent agricultural modifications that affected exposure to sunlight.[19]",

    "content": "### History\nThe Phoenicians first developed the practice of contour farming and spread it throughout the Mediterranean. However, the Romans preferred cultivation in straight furrows and this practice became standard.[6]\n\n### Modern History\nThis was one of the main procedures promoted by the US Soil Conservation Service (the current Natural Resources Conservation Service) during the 1930s. The US Department of Agriculture established the Soil Conservation Service in 1935 during the Dust Bowl when it became apparent that soil erosion was a huge problem along with desertification. The extent of the problem was such that the 1934 \"Yearbook of Agriculture\" noted that Approximately 35 million acres [142,000 km2] of formerly cultivated land have essentially been destroyed for crop production. . . . 100 million acres [405,000 km2] now in crops have lost all or most of the topsoil; 125 million acres [506,000 km2] of land now in crops are rapidly losing topsoil. This can lead to large-scale desertification, permanently transforming a formerly productive landscape into an arid one that becomes increasingly intensive and expensive to farm.[7] The Soil Conservation Service worked with state governments and universities with established agriculture programs, such as the University of Nebraska, to promote the method to farmers. By 1938, the introduction of new agricultural techniques, such as contour plowing, had reduced soil loss by 65% despite the continuation of the drought. Demonstrations showed that contour farming, under ideal conditions, will increase yields of row crops by up to 50%, with increases of between 5 and 10% being common. Importantly, the technique also significantly reduces soil erosion and fertilizer loss, making farming less energy and resource-intensive under most circumstances.[8] Reducing fertilizer loss saves the farmer time and money and decreases the risk of harming regional freshwater systems. Soil erosion caused by heavy rain can encourage the development of rills and gullies which carry excess nutrients into freshwater systems through the process of eutrophication[9] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with rainfall patterns similar to those in the United States, such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period. On steeper slopes and areas with greater rainfall, a procedure known as strip cropping is used with contour farming to provide additional protection.[10] Contour farming is most effective when used with other soil conservation methods such as terrace farming, and the use of cover crops.[11] The proper combination of such farming methods can be determined by various climatic and soil conditions of that given area. Farming sites are often classified into five levels: insensitive, mild, moderate, high, and extreme, depending on the region's soil sensitivity.[12] Contour farming is applied in certain European countries such as Belgium, Italy, Greece, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain in areas with higher than 10% slope.[13] P. A. Yeomans' Keyline design system is critical of traditional contour plowing techniques and improves the system through observing normal landforms and topography. At one end of a contour, the slope of the land will always be steeper than at the other. Thus, when plowing parallel runs paralleling any contour, the plow furrows soon deviate from a true contour. Rainwater in these furrows will flow sideways along the falling \"contour\" line. This can often concentrate water to exacerbate erosion instead of reducing it. Yeomans was the first to appreciate the significance of this phenomenon. Keyline cultivation utilizes this \"off contour\" drift in cultivating furrows to control the movement of rainwater for the benefit of the land.",

    "title": "Shifting Cultivation",
    "content": "### Political Ecology\nShifting cultivation is a form of agriculture or a cultivation system in which, at any particular point in time, a minority of 'fields' are in cultivation and a majority are in various stages of natural re-growth. Over time, fields are cultivated for a relatively short time, and allowed to recover, or are fallowed, for a relatively long time. Eventually a previously cultivated field will be cleared of the natural vegetation and planted in crops again. Fields in established and stable shifting cultivation systems are cultivated and fallowed cyclically. This type of farming is called jhumming in India.[1] Fallow fields are not unproductive. During the fallow period, shifting cultivators use the successive vegetation species widely for timber for fencing and construction, firewood, thatching, ropes, clothing, tools, carrying devices and medicines. It is common for fruit and nut trees to be planted in fallow fields to the extent that parts of some fallows are in fact orchards. Soil-enhancing shrub or tree species may be planted or protected from slashing or burning in fallows. Many of these species have been shown to fix nitrogen. Fallows commonly contain plants that attract birds and animals and are important for hunting. But perhaps most importantly, tree fallows protect soil against physical erosion and draw nutrients to the surface from deep in the soil profile. The relationship between the time the land is cultivated and the time it is fallowed are critical to the stability of shifting cultivation systems. These parameters determine whether or not the shifting cultivation system as a whole suffers a net loss of nutrients over time. A system in which there is a net loss of nutrients with each cycle will eventually lead to a degradation of resources unless actions are taken to arrest the losses. In some cases soil can be irreversibly exhausted (including erosion as well as nutrient loss) in less than a decade. The longer a field is cropped, the greater the loss of soil organic matter, cation-exchange-capacity and in nitrogen and phosphorus, the greater the increase in acidity, the more likely soil porosity and infiltration capacity is reduced and the greater the loss of seeds of naturally occurring plant species from soil seed banks. In a stable shifting cultivation system, the fallow is long enough for the natural vegetation to recover to the state that it was in before it was cleared, and for the soil to recover to the condition it was in before cropping began. During fallow periods soil temperatures are lower, wind and water erosion is much reduced, nutrient cycling becomes closed again, nutrients are extracted from the subsoil, soil fauna decreases, acidity is reduced, soil structure, texture and moisture characteristics improve and seed banks are replenished. The secondary forests created by shifting cultivation are commonly richer in plant and animal resources useful to humans than primary forests, even though they are much less bio-diverse. Shifting cultivators view the forest as an agricultural landscape of fields at various stages in a regular cycle. People unused to living in forests cannot see the fields for the trees. Rather they perceive an apparently chaotic landscape in which trees are cut and burned randomly and so they characterise shifting cultivation as ephemeral or 'pre-agricultural', as 'primitive' and as a stage to be progressed beyond. Shifting agriculture is none of these things. Stable shifting cultivation systems are highly variable, closely adapted to micro-environments and are carefully managed by farmers during both the cropping and fallow stages. Shifting cultivators may possess a highly developed knowledge and understanding of their local environments and of the crops and native plant species they exploit. Complex and highly adaptive land tenure systems sometimes exist under shifting cultivation. Introduced crops for food and as cash have been skillfully integrated into some shifting cultivation systems. Its disadvantages include the high initial cost, as manual labour is required.\n\n### In Europe\nShifting cultivation was still being practised as a viable and stable form of agriculture in many parts of Europe and east into Siberia at the end of the 19th century and in some places well into the 20th century. In the Ruhr in the late 1860s a forest-field rotation system known as Reutbergwirtschaft (de) was using a 16-year cycle of clearing, cropping and fallowing with trees to produce bark for tanneries, wood for charcoal and rye for flour (Darby 1956, 200). Swidden farming was practised in Siberia at least until the 1930s, using specially selected varieties of \"swidden-rye\" (Steensberg 1993, 98). In Eastern Europe and Northern Russia the main swidden crops were turnips, barley, flax, rye, wheat, oats, radishes and millet. Cropping periods were usually one year, but were extended to two or three years on very favourable soils. Fallow periods were between 20 and 40 years (Linnard 1970, 195). In Finland in 1949, Steensberg (1993, 111) observed the clearing and burning of a 60,000 square metres (15 acres) swidden 440 km north of Helsinki. Birch and pine trees had been cleared over a period of a year and the logs sold for cash. A fallow of alder (Alnus) was encouraged to improve soil conditions. After the burn, turnip was sown for sale and for cattle feed. Shifting cultivation was disappearing in this part of Finland because of a loss of agricultural labour to the industries of the towns. Steensberg (1993, 110–152) provides eye-witness descriptions of shifting cultivation being practised in Sweden in the 20th century, and in Estonia, Poland, the Caucasus, Serbia, Bosnia, Hungary, Switzerland, Austria and Germany in the 1930s to the 1950s. That these agricultural practices survived from the Neolithic into the middle of the 20th century amidst the sweeping changes that occurred in Europe over that period, suggests they were adaptive and in themselves, were not massively destructive of the environments in which they were practiced. The earliest written accounts of deforestation in Southern Europe begin around 1000 BC in the histories of Homer, Thucydides and Plato and in Strabo's Geography. Forests were exploited for ship building, and urban development, the manufacture of casks, pitch and charcoal, as well as being cleared for agriculture. The intensification of trade and as a result of warfare, increased the demand for ships which were manufactured completely from forest products. Although goat herding is singled out as an important cause of environmental degradation, a more important cause of forest destruction was the practice in some places of granting ownership rights to those who clear felled forests and brought the land into permanent cultivation. Evidence that circumstances other than agriculture were the major causes for forest destruction was the recovery of tree cover in many parts of the Roman empire from 400 BC to around 500 AD following the collapse of Roman economy and industry. Darby observes that by 400 AD \"land that had once been tilled became derelict and overgrown\" and quotes Lactantius who wrote that in many places \"cultivated land became forest\" (Darby 1956, 186). The other major cause of forest destruction in the Mediterranean environment with its hot dry summers were wild fires that became more common following human interference in the forests. In Central and Northern Europe the use of stone tools and fire in agriculture is well established in the palynological and archaeological record from the Neolithic. Here, just as in Southern Europe, the demands of more intensive agriculture and the invention of the plough, trading, mining and smelting, tanning, building and construction in the growing towns and constant warfare, including the demands of naval shipbuilding, were more important forces behind the destruction of the forests than was shifting cultivation.

Over time, fields are cultivated for a relatively short time, and allowed to recover, or are fallowed, for a relatively long time.

    "content": "### History\nHistorically, slash-and-burn cultivation has been practiced throughout much of the world. Fire was already used by hunter-gatherers before the invention of agriculture, and still is in present times. Clearings created by the fire were made for many reasons, such as to provide new growth for game animals and to promote certain kinds of edible plants. During the Neolithic Revolution, groups of hunter-gatherers domesticated various plants and animals, permitting them to settle down and practice agriculture, which provided more nutrition per hectare than hunting and gathering. Some groups could easily plant their crops in open fields along river valleys, but others had forests covering their land. Thus, since Neolithic times, slash-and-burn agriculture has been widely used to clear land to make it suitable for crops and livestock.[10] Large groups wandering in the woodlands was once a common form of society in European prehistory. The extended family burned and cultivated their swidden plots, sowed one or more crops, and then proceeded on to the next plot.[11]\n\n### Technique\nSlash-and-burn fields are typically used and owned by a family until the soil is exhausted. At this point the ownership rights are abandoned, the family clears a new field, and trees and shrubs are permitted to grow on the former field. After a few decades, another family or clan may then use the land and claim usufructuary rights. In such a system there is typically no market in farmland, so land is not bought or sold on the open market and land rights are traditional.[citation needed] In slash-and-burn agriculture, forests are typically cut months before a dry season. The \"slash\" is permitted to dry and then burned in the following dry season. The resulting ash fertilizes the soil[12][13] and the burned field is then planted at the beginning of the next rainy season with crops such as rice, maize, cassava, or other staples. This work was once done using simple tools such as machetes, axes, hoes and shovels.\n\n### Benefits And Drawbacks\nThis system of agriculture provides millions of people with food and income. It has been ecologically sustainable for thousands of years. Because the leached soil in many tropical regions, such as the Amazon, are nutritionally extremely poor, slash-and-burn is one of the only types of agriculture which can be practiced in these areas. Slash-and-burn farmers typically plant a variety of crops, instead of a monoculture, and contribute to a higher biodiversity due to creating mosaic habitats. The general ecosystem is not harmed in traditional slash-and-burn, aside from a small temporary patch. This technique is most unsuitable for the production of cash crops. A huge amount of land, or a low density of people, is required for sustainable slash-and-burn. When slash-and-burn is practiced in the same area too often, e.g., because the human population density has increased to an unsustainable level, the forest will eventually be destroyed.\n\n### Asia\nTribal groups in the northeastern Indian states of Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland and the Bangladeshi districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari, Bandarban and Sylhet refer to slash-and-burn agriculture as podu, jhum or jhoom cultivation. The system involves clearing land, by fire or clear-felling, for economically important crops such as upland rice, vegetables or fruits. After a few cycles, the land's fertility declines and a new area is chosen. Jhum cultivation is most often practiced on the slopes of thickly-forested hills. Cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the land, burning the trees and grasses for fresh soil. Although it is believed that this helps fertilize the land, it can leave it vulnerable to erosion. Holes are made for the seeds of crops[14] such as sticky rice, maize, eggplant and cucumber. After considering jhum's effects, the government of Mizoram has introduced a policy to end the method in the state.[15] Vietnam is home to a diverse range of ethnic groups. Some of these groups form primarily rural communities that reside far from the larger cities of the country, living on swidden fields where slash-and-burn agriculture is still in regular use as a part of everyday life.[16]\n\n### Americas\nSome American civilizations, like the Maya, have used slash-and-burn cultivation since ancient times. Native Americans in the United States also used fire in agriculture and hunting.[17] In the Amazon, many peoples such as the Yanomami Indians also live off the slash and burn method due to the Amazon's poor soil quality.[18] Indigenous peoples in what is now modern-day Brazil also utilized slash-and-burn agriculture as land management in the Atlantic Forest prior to European colonization.[19]\n\n### Portugal\nIn Portugal, slash-and-burn agriculture was historically known as roças and queimadas. Until the early 20th century, it was a pervasive element of the rural economy, particularly in the southern regions of Beira Baixa and Alentejo, as well as in mountain areas. The French historian Albert Silbert, in his study of the region's agrarian history, described the practice as a \"mode of production that occupied a central place in agricultural life,\" noting similarities to tropical swidden systems.[20] The traditional agricultural cycle involved cutting vegetation in the spring, allowing it to dry, and burning it in August. The ash fertilized the soil for the cultivation of cereals such as rye, wheat, and barley, which were planted with the onset of the first rains. This practice supported a socio-ecological mosaic of cultivated fields, moors (charnecas), common lands (baldios), and woodlands.[20] The decline of slash-and-burn in Portugal began with the rise of the modern liberal state in the 19th century, which privatized common lands and confiscated ecclesial properties. Enlightened agrarian reformers increasingly characterized the practice as backward and destructive. In 1886, the newly established Forestry Service banned queimadas within 200 meters of state forests, a distance extended to one kilometer in 1926.[20] The eradication of the practice accelerated under the Estado Novo dictatorship (1933–1974). Policies such as the Wheat Campaign of 1929 and the Afforestation Law of 1938 sought to transform uncultivated moors into wheat monocultures and upland commons into state forests. These \"fascist modernist landscapes\" were designed to exclude fire, backed by scientific forestry narratives that viewed swidden cultivation as primitive. By the mid-1960s, state-sponsored afforestation—often utilizing fast-growing species like Eucalyptus globulus for the pulp industry—had further marginalized traditional fire use.[20] While roças and queimadas have largely vanished, modern experts argue that the exclusion of fire contributed to the severity of contemporary wildfires. The accumulation of fuel loads, combined with rural flight and monoculture plantations, has created a landscape prone to destructive mega-fires, leading some researchers to reconsider the utility of traditional fire management techniques.[20]\n\n### Northern Europe\nSlash-and-burn techniques were used in northeastern Sweden in agricultural systems. In Sweden, the practice is known as svedjebruk.[21] Telkkämäki Nature Reserve in Kaavi, Finland, is an open-air museum where slash-and-burn agriculture is demonstrated. Farm visitors can see how people farmed when slash-and-burn was the norm in the Northern Savonian region of eastern Finland beginning in the 15th century. Areas of the reserve are burnt each year.[22] Svedjebruk is a form of slash-and-burn agriculture practiced in Sweden and Norway. It originated in Russia in the region of Novgorod and was widespread in Finland and Eastern Sweden during the Medieval period. It spread to western Sweden in the 16th century when Finnish settlers were encouraged to migrate there by King Gustav Vasa to help clear the dense forests. Later, when the Finns were pers",

    "title": "Compost",
    "content": "### Fundamentals\nComposting is an aerobic method of decomposing organic solid wastes,[8] so it can be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposing organic material into a humus-like material, known as compost, which is a good fertilizer for plants. Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:[3] Certain ratios of these materials allow microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the compost pile. Active management of the pile (e.g., turning over the compost heap) is needed to maintain sufficient oxygen and the right moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures 130–160 °F (54–71 °C) until the materials are broken down.[9] Composting is most efficient with a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of about 25:1.[10] Hot composting focuses on retaining heat to increase the decomposition rate, thus producing compost more quickly. Rapid composting is favored by having a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of about 30 carbon units or less. Above 30, the substrate is nitrogen starved. Below 15, it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia.[11] Nearly all dead plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen in different amounts.[12] Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15:1 and dry autumn leaves about 50:1 depending upon species.[3] Composting is an ongoing and dynamic process; adding new sources of carbon and nitrogen consistently, as well as active management, is important.\n\n### Organisms\nOrganisms can break down organic matter in compost if provided with the correct mixture of water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.[3] They fall into two broad categories: chemical decomposers, which perform chemical processes on the organic waste, and physical decomposers, which process the waste into smaller pieces through methods such as grinding, tearing, chewing, and digesting.[3]\n\n### Phases Of Composting\nUnder ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:[16][17] Semicomposting is the degradation process that handles volumes of organic waste lower than that recommended for composting and therefore does not present a thermophilic stage, because mesophilic microorganisms are the only responsible ones, for the degradation of organic matter.[18][19]\n\n### Hot And Cold Composting – Impact On Timing\nThe time required to compost material relates to the volume of material, the particle size of the inputs (e.g. wood chips break down faster than branches), and the amount of mixing and aeration.[3] Generally, larger piles reach higher temperatures and remain in a thermophilic stage for days or weeks. This is hot composting and is the usual method for large-scale municipal facilities and agricultural operations. The Berkeley method produces finished compost in 18 days. It requires assembly of at least 1 cubic metre (35 cu ft) of material at the outset and needs turning every two days after an initial four-day phase.[20] Such short processes involve some changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized particle sizes in the input materials, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30:1 or less, and careful monitoring of the moisture level. Cold composting is a slower process that can take up to a year to complete.[21] It results from smaller piles, including many residential compost piles that receive small amounts of kitchen and garden waste over extended periods. Piles smaller than 1 cubic metre (35 cu ft) tend not to reach and maintain high temperatures.[22] Turning is not necessary with cold composting, although a risk exists that parts of the pile may go anaerobic as it becomes compacted or waterlogged.\n\n### Pathogen Removal\nComposting can destroy some pathogens and seeds, by reaching temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F).[23] \nDealing with stabilized compost – i.e. composted material in which microorganisms have finished digesting the organic matter and the temperature has reached between 50 and 70 °C (122 and 158 °F) – poses very little risk, as these temperatures kill pathogens and even make oocysts unviable.[24] The temperature at which a pathogen dies depends on the pathogen, how long the temperature is maintained (seconds to weeks), and pH.[25] Compost products such as compost tea and compost extracts have been found to have an inhibitory effect on Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia species, and Pythium debaryanum, plant pathogens that can cause crop diseases.[26] Aerated compost teas are more effective than compost extracts.[26] The microbiota and enzymes present in compost extracts also have a suppressive effect on fungal plant pathogens.[27] Compost is a good source of biocontrol agents like B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, and P. chrysogenum that fight plant pathogens.[26] Sterilizing the compost, compost tea, or compost extracts reduces the effect of pathogen suppression.[26]\n\n### Diseases That Can Be Contracted From Handling Compost\nWhen turning compost that has not gone through phases where temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) are reached, a mouth mask and gloves must be worn to protect from diseases that can be contracted from handling compost, including:[28] Oocytes are rendered unviable by temperatures over 50 °C (122 °F).[24]\n\n### Environmental Benefits\nCompost adds organic matter to the soil and increases the nutrient content and biodiversity of microbes in soil.[29] Composting at home reduces the amount of green waste being hauled to dumps or composting facilities. The reduced volume of materials being picked up by trucks results in fewer trips, which in turn lowers the overall emissions from the waste-management fleet.\n\n### Materials That Can Be Composted\nPotential sources of compostable materials, or feedstocks, include residential, agricultural, and commercial waste streams. Residential food or yard waste can be composted at home,[30] or collected for inclusion in a large-scale municipal composting facility. In some regions, it could also be included in a local or neighborhood composting project.[31][32]\n\n### Organic Solid Waste\nThe two broad categories of organic solid waste are green and brown.  Green waste is generally considered a source of nitrogen and includes pre- and post-consumer food waste, grass clippings, garden trimmings, and fresh leaves.[1] Animal carcasses, roadkill, and butcher residue can also be composted, and these are considered nitrogen sources.[33] Brown waste is a carbon source. Typical examples are dried vegetation and woody material such as fallen leaves, straw, woodchips, limbs, logs, pine needles, sawdust, and wood ash, but not charcoal ash.[1][34]  Products derived from wood such as paper and plain cardboard are also considered carbon sources.[1]\n\n### Animal Manure And Bedding\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal manure generated on the farm as a nitrogen source, and bedding as the carbon source. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Nontraditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard.[1] The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure must be blended with high-carbon, low-nitrogen materials.[35]\n\n### Human Excreta\nHuman excreta, sometimes called \"humanure\" in the composting context,[36][37] can be added as an input to the composting process since it is a nutrient-rich organic material. Nitrogen, which serves as a building block for important plant amino acids, is found in solid human waste.[38][39] Phosphorus, which helps plants convert sunlight into energy in the form of ATP, can be found in liquid human waste.[",

    "title": "Mulch",
    "content": "### Uses\nMany materials are used as mulches, which are used to retain soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and for aesthetics.[4] They are applied to the soil surface,[5] around trees, paths, flower beds, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, and in production areas for flower and vegetable crops. Mulch layers are normally 5 centimetres (2 in) or more deep when applied.[6][7] Although mulch can be applied around established plants at any time,[8] they may be applied at various times of the year depending on the purpose. Towards the beginning of the growing season, mulches serve initially to warm the soil by helping it retain heat which is otherwise lost during the night. This allows early seeding and transplanting of certain crops, and encourages faster growth. Mulch acts as an insulator. As the season progresses, mulch stabilizes the soil temperature and moisture, and prevents the growing of weeds from seeds.[9]: 768 In temperate climates, the effects of mulches depend upon the time of year in which they are applied. When applied in fall and winter, mulches delay the growth of perennial plants in the spring and prevent growth in winter during warm spells, thus limiting freeze–thaw damage.[10] The effect of mulch upon soil moisture content is complex. Mulch forms a layer between the soil and the atmosphere reducing evaporation.[11] However, mulch can also prevent water from reaching the soil by absorbing or blocking water from light rains and overly thick layers of mulch can reduce oxygen in the soil.[12] In order to maximise the benefits of mulch, while minimizing its negative influences, it is often applied in late spring/early summer when soil temperatures have risen sufficiently, but soil moisture content is still relatively high.[13] However, permanent mulch is also widely used and valued for its simplicity, as popularized by author Ruth Stout, who said, \"My way is simply to keep a thick mulch of any vegetable matter that rots on both sides of my vegetable and flower garden all year long. As it decays and enriches the soils, I add more.\"[14]\n\n### Materials\nMaterials used as mulches vary and depend on a number of factors. Use takes into consideration availability, cost, appearance, the effect it has on the soil—including chemical reactions and pH, durability, combustibility, rate of decomposition, how clean it is—some can contain weed seeds or plant pathogens.[9]: 768 A variety of materials are used as mulch: In some areas of the United States, such as central Pennsylvania and northern California, mulch is often referred to as \"tanbark\", even by manufacturers and distributors. In these areas, the word \"mulch\" is used specifically to refer to very fine tanbark or peat moss.\n\n### Organic Mulches\nOrganic mulches decay over time and are temporary. The way a particular organic mulch decomposes and reacts to wetting by rain and dew affects its usefulness. Some mulches such as straw, peat, sawdust and other wood products may for a while negatively affect plant growth because of their wide carbon to nitrogen ratio,[18] because bacteria and fungi that decompose the materials remove nitrogen from the surrounding soil for growth.[19] Organic mulches can mat down, forming a barrier that blocks water and air flow between the soil and the atmosphere. Vertically applied organic mulches can wick water from the soil to the surface, which can dry out the soil.[20] Mulch made with wood can contain or feed termites, so care must be taken about not placing mulch too close to houses or building that can be damaged by those insects. Mulches placed too close to plant stems and tree trunks can contribute to their failure. Some mulch manufacturers recommend putting mulch several inches away from buildings. Commonly available organic mulches include:[9]: 768–772 Leaves from deciduous trees, which drop their foliage in the autumn/fall. They tend to be dry and blow around in the wind, so are often chopped or shredded before application. As they decompose they adhere to each other but also allow water and moisture to seep down to the soil surface. Thick layers of entire leaves, especially of maples and oaks, can form a soggy mat in winter and spring which can impede the new growth of lawn grass and other plants. Dry leaves are used as winter mulches to protect plants from freezing and thawing in areas with cold winters; they are normally removed during spring. Grass clippings, from mowed lawns are sometimes collected and used elsewhere as mulch. Grass clippings are dense and tend to mat down, so are mixed with tree leaves or rough compost to provide aeration and to facilitate their decomposition without smelly putrefaction. Rotting fresh grass clippings can damage plants; their rotting often produces a damaging buildup of trapped heat. Grass clippings are often dried thoroughly before application, which militates against rapid decomposition and excessive heat generation. Fresh green grass clippings are relatively high in nitrate content, and when used as a mulch, much of the nitrate is returned to the soil, conversely the routine removal of grass clippings from the lawn results in nitrogen deficiency for the lawn. Peat moss, or sphagnum peat, is long lasting and packaged, making it convenient and popular as a mulch. When wetted and dried, it can form a dense crust that does not allow water to soak in. When dry it can also burn, producing a smoldering fire. It is sometimes mixed with pine needles to produce a mulch that is friable. It can also lower the pH of the soil surface, making it useful as a mulch under acid loving plants. However, peat bogs are a valuable wildlife habitat, and peat is also one of the largest stores of carbon (in Britain, out of a total estimated  9952 million tonnes of carbon in British vegetation and soils, 6948 million tonnes carbon are estimated to be in Scottish, mostly peatland, soils).[21] Wood chips are a byproduct of the pruning of trees by arborists, utilities and parks; they are used to dispose of bulky waste. Tree branches and large stems are rather coarse after chipping and tend to be used as a mulch at least three inches thick. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. Wood chip mulches on the top of the soil increase nutrient levels in soils and associated plant foliage, contrary to the myth that wood chip mulch tie up nitrogen.[22][23][24] Wood chips are most often used under trees and shrubs. When used around soft stemmed plants, an unmulched zone is left around the plant stems to prevent stem rot or other possible diseases. They are often used to mulch trails, because they are readily produced with little additional cost outside of the normal disposal cost of tree maintenance. Wood chips come in various colors. Woodchip mulch is a byproduct of reprocessing used (untreated) timber (usually packaging pallets), to dispose of wood waste. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. Woodchip mulch is often used under trees, shrubs or large planting areas and can last much longer than arborist mulch. In addition, many consider woodchip mulch to be visually appealing, as it comes in various colors. Woodchips can also be reprocessed into playground woodchip to be used as an impact-attenuating playground surfacing. Bark chips of various grades are produced from the outer corky bark layer of timber trees. Sizes vary from thin shredded strands to large coarse blocks. The finer types are very attractive but have a large exposed surface area that leads to quicker decay. Layers two or three inches deep are usually used, bark is relativity inert and its decay does not demand soil nitrates. Bark chips are also available in various colors. Straw mulch or field hay or salt hay are lightweight and normally sold in compressed bales. They have an unkempt look and are used in vegetable gardens and as a winter covering. They ",

    "title": "Nitrogen Cycle",
    "content": "### Processes\nNitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, ammonium (NH+4), nitrite (NO−2), nitrate (NO−3), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes in the nitrogen cycle is to transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used by plants. The diagram alongside shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.\n\n### Nitrogen Fixation\nThe conversion of nitrogen gas (N2) into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric, industrial and biological processes is called nitrogen fixation. Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or \"fixed\", into a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5 and 10 billion kg per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of molybdenum (Mo)-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups.[22] An example of free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process,[23] which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.[24]\n\n### Assimilation\nPlants can absorb nitrate or ammonium from the soil by their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between Rhizobia bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship.[25] While many animals, fungi, and other heterotrophic organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of amino acids, nucleotides, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many bacteria) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources.  Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.\n\n### Ammonification\nWhen a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is organic, present in forms such as amino acids and DNA.[26] Bacteria and fungi convert this organic nitrogen into ammonia and sometimes ammonium through a series of processes called ammonification or mineralization. This is the last step in the nitrogen cycle step involving organic compounds.[27] Myriad enzymes are involved including dehydrogenases, proteases, and deaminases such as glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase.[28] Nitrogen mineralization and ammonification have a positive correlation with organic nitrogen in the soil,[29] soil microbial biomass, and average annual precipitation.[30] They also respond closely to changes in temperature.[31] However, these processes slow in the presence of vegetation with high carbon to nitrogen ratios[32][33] and fertilization with sugar.[34][35]\n\n### Nitrification\nThe conversion of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH+4) is performed by bacteria such as the Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO−2). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites (NO−2) into nitrates (NO−3). It is important for the ammonia (NH3) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants. Due to their very high solubility and because soils are highly unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter groundwater. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome.[38] Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to eutrophication, a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.\n\n### Denitrification\nDenitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Paracoccus, under anaerobic conditions. They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively (meaning optionally) anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants. Denitrification occurs in free-living microorganisms as well as obligate symbionts of anaerobic ciliates.[39]\n\n### Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction To Ammonium\nDissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an anaerobic respiration process. Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise organic matter and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to nitrite, then ammonium (NO−3  →  NO−2  →  NH+4).[40] Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.[41]\n\n### Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidation\nThe ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation process is also known as the ANAMMOX process, an abbreviation coined by joining the first syllables of each of these three words. This biological process is a redox comproportionation reaction, in which ammonia (the reducing agent giving electrons) and nitrite (the oxidizing agent accepting electrons) transfer three electrons and are converted into one molecule of diatomic nitrogen (N2) gas and two water molecules. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans. The stoichiometrically balanced formula for the ANAMMOX chemical reaction can be written as following, where an ammonium ion includes the ammonia molecule, its conjugated base: This an exergonic process (he",

    "content": "### Description\nThe primary materials needed for the process of humification are plant detritus, dead animals and microbes (necromass), excreta of all soil organisms, and also black carbon resulting from past fires.[16] The composition of humus varies with that of primary (plant) materials and secondary microbial and animal products. The decomposition rate of the different compounds will affect the composition of the humus.[17] It is difficult to define humus precisely because it is a very complex substance which is still not fully understood. According to the classical conception of Selman Waksman, long-time reported in most textbooks of soil science, humus is different from decomposing soil organic matter. The latter looks rough and has visible remains of the original plant, animal or microbial matter, while fully humified humus, on the contrary, is amorphous and has a uniformly dark, spongy, and jelly-like appearance.[18] However, when examined under a light microscope, humus may reveal tiny plant, animal, and microbial remains that have been mechanically, but not chemically, degraded.[19] This suggests an ambiguous boundary between humus and soil organic matter, leading some authors to contest the use of the term humus and derived terms such as humic substances or humification, proposing the Soil Continuum Model (SCM).[20] However, humus can be considered as having distinct properties, mostly linked to its richness in functional groups, justifying its maintenance as a specific term.[2] Fully formed humus is essentially a collection of very large and complex molecules formed in part from lignin and other polyphenolic molecules of the original plant material (foliage, wood, bark), in part from similar molecules that have been produced by microbes.[21] During decomposition processes these polyphenols are modified chemically so that they are able to join up with one another to form very large molecules. Some parts of these molecules are modified in such a way that protein molecules, amino acids, and amino sugars are able to attach themselves to the polyphenol \"base\" molecule. As protein contains both nitrogen and sulfur, this attachment gives humus a moderate content of these two important plant nutrients.[22] Radiocarbon and other dating techniques have shown that the polyphenolic base of humus (mostly lignin and black carbon) can be very old, but the protein and carbohydrate attachments much younger, while to the light of modern concepts and methods the situation appears much more complex and unpredictable than previously thought.[23] It seems that microbes are able to pull protein off humus molecules rather more readily than they are able to break the polyphenolic base molecule itself. As protein is removed its place may be taken by younger protein, or this younger protein may attach itself to another part of the humus molecule.[24] The most useful functions of humus are in improving soil structure, all the more when associated with cations (e.g. calcium),[25] and in providing a very large surface area that can hold nutrient elements until required by plants, an ion exchange function comparable to that of clay particles.[26] Soil carbon sequestration is a major property of the soil, also considered as an ecosystem service.[27] Only when it becomes stable and acquires its multi-century permanence, mostly via multiple interactions with the soil matrix, should molecular soil humus be considered to be of significance in removing the atmosphere's current carbon dioxide overload.[28] There is little data available on the composition of humus because it is a complex mixture that is challenging for researchers to analyze. Researchers in the 1940s and 1960s tried using chemical separation to analyze plant and humic compounds in forest and agricultural soils, but this proved impossible because extractants interacted with the analysed organic matter and created many artefacts.[29] Further research has been done in more recent years, though it remains an active field of study.[30]\n\n### Humification\nMicroorganisms decompose a large portion of the soil organic matter into inorganic minerals that the roots of plants can absorb as nutrients. This process is termed mineralization. In this process, nitrogen (nitrogen cycle) and the other nutrients (nutrient cycle) in the decomposed organic matter are recycled. Depending on the conditions in which the decomposition occurs, a fraction of the organic matter does not mineralize and instead is transformed by a process called humification. Prior to modern analytical methods, early evidence led scientists to believe that humification resulted in concatenations of organic polymers resistant to the action of microorganisms,[31] however recent research has demonstrated that microorganisms are capable of digesting humus.[32] Humification can occur naturally in soil or artificially in the production of compost. Organic matter is humified by a combination of saprotrophic fungi, bacteria, microbes and animals such as earthworms, nematodes, protozoa, and arthropods (see Soil biology and Soil animals). Plant remains, including those that animals digested and excreted, contain organic compounds: sugars, starches, proteins, carbohydrates, lignins, waxes, resins, and organic acids. Decay in the soil begins with the decomposition of sugars and starches from carbohydrates, which decompose easily as detritivores initially invade the dead plant organs, while the remaining cellulose and lignin decompose more slowly. Simple proteins, organic acids, starches, and sugars decompose rapidly, while crude proteins, fats, waxes, and resins remain relatively unchanged for longer periods of time.[33] Lignin, which is quickly transformed by white-rot fungi,[34] is one of the primary precursors of humus,[35] together with by-products of microbial[36] and animal[37] activity. The humus produced by humification is thus a mixture of compounds and complex biological chemicals of plant, animal, and microbial origin that has many functions and benefits in soil.[21] Some judge earthworm humus (vermicompost) to be the optimal organic manure.[38]\n\n### Stability\nMuch of the humus in most soils has persisted for more than 100 years, rather than having been decomposed into CO2, and can be regarded as stable; this organic matter has been protected from decomposition by microbial or enzyme action because it is hidden (occluded) inside small aggregates of soil particles, or tightly sorbed or complexed to clays.[39] Most humus that is not protected in this way is decomposed within 10 years and can be regarded as less stable or more labile.[40] The mixing activity of soil-consuming invertebrates (e.g. earthworms, termites, some millipedes) contribute to the stability of humus by favouring the formation of mineral-organic complexes with clay minerals at the inside of their guts,[41][42] hence more carbon sequestration in humus forms such as mull and amphi, with well-developed mineral-organic horizons, when compared with moder and mor where most organic matter accumulates at the soil surface.[43] Stable humus contributes few plant-available nutrients in soil, but it helps maintain its physical structure.[44] A very stable form of humus is formed from the slow oxidation of soil carbon after the incorporation of finely powdered charcoal into the topsoil, suggested to result from the grinding and mixing activity of a tropical earthworm.[45] This process is speculated to have been important in the formation of the unusually fertile Amazonian terra preta do Indio, also called Amazonian Dark Earths.[46] However, some authors[20] suggest that complex soil organic molecules may be much less stable than previously thought: \"the available evidence does not support the formation of large-molecular-size and persistent 'humic substances' in soils. Instead, soil organic matter is a continuum of progressively decomposing organic compounds.″\n\n### Horizons\nHumus has a characteristic ",

    "content": "### History\nBiological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Boussingault in 1838.[8][9] Later, in 1880, the process by which it happens was discovered by German agronomist Hermann Hellriegel and Hermann Wilfarth (de)[10] and was fully described by Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck.[11] \"The protracted investigations of the relation of plants to the acquisition of nitrogen begun by de Saussure, Ville, Lawes, Gilbert and others, and culminated in the discovery of symbiotic fixation by Hellriegel and Wilfarth in 1887.\"[12] \"Experiments by Bossingault in 1855 and Pugh, Gilbert & Lawes in 1887 had shown that nitrogen did not enter the plant directly. The discovery of the role of nitrogen-fixing bacteria by Herman Hellriegel and Herman Wilfarth in 1886–1888 would open a new era of soil science.\"[13] In 1901, Beijerinck showed that Azotobacter chroococcum was able to fix atmospheric nitrogen. This was the first known species of the Azotobacter genus, so-named by him. It is also the first known diazotroph, species that use diatomic nitrogen as a step in the complete nitrogen cycle.[14]\n\n### Biological\nBiological nitrogen fixation (BNF) occurs when atmospheric nitrogen is converted to ammonia by a nitrogenase enzyme.[1] The overall reaction for BNF is: The process is coupled to the hydrolysis of 16 equivalents of ATP and is accompanied by the co-formation of one equivalent of H2. The conversion of N2 into ammonia occurs at a metal cluster called FeMoco, an abbreviation for the iron-molybdenum cofactor. The mechanism proceeds via a series of protonation and reduction steps wherein the FeMoco active site hydrogenates the N2 substrate.[1] In free-living diazotrophs, nitrogenase-generated ammonia is assimilated into glutamate through the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway. The microbial nif genes required for nitrogen fixation are widely distributed in diverse environments.[15] Nitrogenases are rapidly degraded by oxygen. For this reason, many bacteria cease production of the enzyme in the presence of oxygen. Many nitrogen-fixing organisms exist only in anaerobic conditions, respiring to draw down oxygen levels, or binding the oxygen with a protein such as leghemoglobin.[16][17]\n\n### Importance Of Nitrogen\nAtmospheric nitrogen cannot be metabolized by most organisms,[18] because its triple covalent bond is very strong. Most take up fixed nitrogen from various sources. For every 100 atoms of carbon, roughly 2 to 20 atoms of nitrogen are assimilated. The atomic ratio of carbon (C) : nitrogen (N) : phosphorus (P) observed on average in planktonic biomass was originally described by Alfred Redfield,[19] who determined the stoichiometric relationship between C:N:P atoms, The Redfield Ratio, to be 106:16:1.[19]\n\n### Nitrogenase\nThe protein complex nitrogenase is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonia (NH3).[20][21] In cyanobacteria, this enzyme system is housed in a specialized cell called the heterocyst.[22] The production of the nitrogenase complex is genetically regulated, and the activity of the protein complex is dependent on ambient oxygen concentrations, and intra- and extracellular concentrations of ammonia and oxidized nitrogen species (nitrate and nitrite).[23][24][25] Additionally, the combined concentrations of both ammonium and nitrate are thought to inhibit NFix, specifically when intracellular concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) exceed a critical threshold.[26] The specialized heterocyst cell is necessary for the performance of nitrogenase as a result of its sensitivity to ambient oxygen.[27] Nitrogenase consist of two proteins, a catalytic iron-dependent protein, commonly referred to as MoFe protein and a reducing iron-only protein (Fe protein). Three iron-dependent proteins are known: molybdenum-dependent, vanadium-dependent, and iron-only, with all three nitrogenase protein variations containing an iron protein component. Molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase is most common.[1] The different types of nitrogenase can be determined by the specific iron protein component.[28] Nitrogenase is highly conserved. Gene expression through DNA sequencing can distinguish which protein complex is present in the microorganism and potentially being expressed. Most frequently, the nifH gene is used to identify the presence of molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase, followed by closely related nitrogenase reductases (component II) vnfH and anfH representing vanadium-dependent and iron-only nitrogenase, respectively.[29] In studying the ecology and evolution of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the nifH gene is the biomarker most widely used.[30] nifH has two similar genes anfH and vnfH that also encode for the nitrogenase reductase component of the nitrogenase complex.[31]\n\n### Evolution Of Nitrogenase\nNitrogenase is thought to have evolved sometime between 1.5-2.2 billion years ago (Ga),[32][33] although there is some isotopic support for nitrogenase evolution as early as around 3.2 Ga.[34] Nitrogenase appears to have evolved from maturase-like proteins, although the function of the preceding protein is currently unknown.[35] Nitrogenase has three different forms (Nif, Anf, and Vnf) that correspond with the metal found in the active site of the protein (molybdenum, iron, and vanadium respectively).[36] Marine metal abundances over Earth's geologic timeline are thought to have driven the relative abundance of which form of nitrogenase was most common.[37] Currently, there is no conclusive agreement on which form of nitrogenase arose first.\n\n### Microorganisms\nDiazotrophs are widespread within domain Bacteria including cyanobacteria (e.g. the highly significant Trichodesmium and Cyanothece), green sulfur bacteria, purple sulfur bacteria, Azotobacteraceae, rhizobia and Frankia.[38][39] Several obligately anaerobic bacteria fix nitrogen including many (but not all) Clostridium spp. Some archaea such as Methanosarcina acetivorans also fix nitrogen,[40] and several other methanogenic taxa, are significant contributors to nitrogen fixation in oxygen-deficient soils.[41] Cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae, inhabit nearly all illuminated environments on Earth and play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere. In general, cyanobacteria can use various inorganic and organic sources of combined nitrogen, such as nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino acids. Several cyanobacteria strains are also capable of diazotrophic growth, an ability that may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archean eon.[42] Nitrogen fixation not only naturally occurs in soils but also aquatic systems, including both freshwater and marine.[43][44] Indeed, the amount of nitrogen fixed in the ocean is at least as much as that on land.[45] The colonial marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally.[46] Marine surface lichens and non-photosynthetic bacteria belonging in Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes fixate significant atmospheric nitrogen.[47] Species of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in fresh waters include: Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum (previously Anabaena).[48] Such species have specialized cells called heterocytes, in which nitrogen fixation occurs via the nitrogenase enzyme.[49][50]\n\n### Algae\nOne type of organelle, originating from cyanobacterial endosymbionts called UCYN-A2,[51][52] can turn nitrogen gas into a biologically available form. This nitroplast was discovered in algae, particularly in the marine algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii.[53] Diatoms in the family Rhopalodiaceae also possess cyanobacterial endosymbionts called spheroid bodies or diazoplasts.[54] These endosymbionts have lost photosynthetic properties, but have kept the ability to perform nitrogen fixation, allowing these diatoms to fix atmospheric nitrogen.[55][56] Other diatoms in symbiosis with ni",

    "content": "### History\nPhosphorus was the first element to be \"discovered\", in the sense that it was not known since ancient times.[12] The discovery is credited to the Hamburg alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669, who was attempting to create the fabled philosopher's stone.[13] To this end, he experimented with urine, which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism.[14] By letting the urine rot (a step later discovered to be unnecessary),[15] boiling it down to a paste, then distilling it at a high temperature and leading the resulting vapours through water, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly. He named it in Latin: phosphorus mirabilis, lit. 'miraculous bearer of light'. The word phosphorus itself (Ancient Greek: Φωσφόρος, romanized: Phōsphoros, lit. 'light-bearer') originates from Greek mythology, where it references the god of the morning star, also known as the planet Venus.[14][16] Brand at first tried to keep the method secret,[17] but later sold the recipe for 200 thalers to Johann Daniel Kraft (de) from Dresden.[14] Kraft toured much of Europe with it, including London, where he met with Robert Boyle. The crucial fact that the substance was made from urine was eventually found out, and Johann Kunckel was able to reproduce it in Sweden in 1678. In 1680, Boyle also managed to make phosphorus and published the method of its manufacture.[14] He was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur-tipped wooden splints, forerunners of modern matches,[18] and also improved the process by using sand in the reaction: Boyle's assistant Ambrose Godfrey-Hanckwitz later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier recognised phosphorus as an element after Johan Gottlieb Gahn and Carl Wilhelm Scheele showed in 1769 that calcium phosphate is found in bones by obtaining elemental phosphorus from bone ash.[10] Bone ash subsequently became the primary industrial source of phosphorus and remained so until the 1840s.[19] The process consisted of several steps.[20][21] First, grinding up the bones into their constituent tricalcium phosphate and treating it with sulfuric acid: Then, dehydrating the resulting monocalcium phosphate: Finally, mixing the obtained calcium metaphosphate with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling phosphorus vapour out of a retort: This way, two-thirds of the phosphorus was turned into white phosphorus while one-third remained in the residue as calcium orthophosphate. The carbon monoxide produced during the reaction process was burnt off in a flare stack. In 1609 Inca Garcilaso de la Vega wrote the book Comentarios Reales in which he described many of the agricultural practices of the Incas prior to the arrival of the Spaniards and introduced the use of guano as a fertiliser. As Garcilaso described, the Incas near the coast harvested guano.[22] In the early 1800s Alexander von Humboldt introduced guano as a source of agricultural fertiliser to Europe after having discovered it in exploitable quantities on islands off the coast of South America. It has been reported that, at the time of its discovery, the guano on some islands was over 30 meters deep.[23] The guano had previously been used by the Moche people as a source of fertiliser by mining it and transporting it back to Peru by boat. International commerce in guano did not start until after 1840.[23] By the start of the 20th century guano had been nearly completely depleted and was eventually overtaken with the discovery of methods of production of superphosphate. Early matches used white phosphorus in their composition, and were very dangerous due to both its toxicity and the way the match was ignited. The first striking match with a phosphorus head was invented by Charles Sauria in 1830. These matches (and subsequent modifications) were made with heads of white phosphorus, an oxygen-releasing compound (potassium chlorate, lead dioxide, or sometimes nitrate), and a binder. They were poisonous to the workers in manufacture, exposure to the vapours causing  severe necrosis of the bones of the jaw, known as \"phossy jaw\".[24] Additionally, they were sensitive to storage conditions, toxic if ingested, and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface.[25][26] The very high risks for match workers was at the source of several notable early cases of industrial action, such as the 1888 London Matchgirls' strike. The discovery of red phosphorus allowed for the development of matches that were both much safer to use and to manufacture, leading to the gradual replacement of white phosphorus in matches. Additionally, around 1900 French chemists Henri Sévène and Emile David Cahen invented the modern strike-anywhere match, wherein the white phosphorus was replaced by phosphorus sesquisulfide (P4S3), a non-toxic and non-pyrophoric compound that ignites under friction. For a time these safer strike-anywhere matches were quite popular but in the long run they were superseded by the modern red phosphorus-based safety match. Following the implementation of these new manufacturing methods, production of white phosphorus matches was banned in several countries between 1872 and 1925,[27] and an international treaty to this effect was signed following the Berne Convention (1906).[28] Phosphate rock, which usually contains calcium phosphate, was first used in 1850 to make phosphorus. With the introduction of the submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production by James Burgess Readman in 1888[29] (patented 1889),[30] the use of bone-ash became obsolete.[21][14] After the depletion of world guano sources about the same time, mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertiliser production. Phosphate rock production greatly increased after World War II, and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today. The electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where it became possible that white phosphorus could be weaponised in war. In World War I, it was used in incendiary ammunition, smoke screens and tracer ammunition. A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen-filled Zeppelins over Britain (hydrogen being highly flammable).[21] During World War II, Molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians as part of the preparations for a potential invasion. The United States also developed the M15 white-phosphorus hand grenade, a precursor to the M34 grenade, while the British introduced the similar No 77 grenade. These multipurpose grenades were mostly used for signaling and smoke screens, although they were also efficient anti-personnel weapons.[31] The difficulty of extinguishing burning phosphorus and the very severe burns it causes had a strong psychological impact on the enemy.[32] Phosphorus incendiary bombs were used on a large scale, notably to destroy Hamburg, the place where the \"miraculous bearer of light\" was first discovered.[16]\n\n### Isotopes\nThere are 22 known isotopes of phosphorus, ranging from 26P to 47P.[11] Only 31P is stable and, therefore, has 100% abundance. The nuclear spin of 1/2 and high abundance of 31P make phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy a very useful analytical tool in studies of phosphorus-containing samples. Two radioactive isotopes of phosphorus have half-lives suitable for biological scientific experiments, and are used as radioactive tracers in biochemical laboratories.[33] These are: The high-energy beta particles from 32P penetrate skin and corneas and any 32P ingested, inhaled, or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids. For these reasons, personnel working with 32P is required to wear lab coats, disposable gloves, and safety glasses, and avoid working directly over open containers. Monitoring personal, clothing, and surface contamination is also required. The hig",

    "title": "Potassium",
    "content": "### Etymology\nThe English name for the element potassium comes from the word potash,[16] which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts: placing in a pot the ash of burnt wood or tree leaves, adding water, heating, and evaporating the solution. When Humphry Davy first isolated the pure element using electrolysis in 1807, he named it potassium, which he derived from the word potash. The symbol K stems from kali, itself from the root word alkali, which in turn comes from Arabic: القَلْيَه al-qalyah 'plant ashes'. In 1797, the German chemist Martin Klaproth discovered \"potash\" in the minerals leucite and lepidolite, and realized that \"potash\" was not a product of plant growth but actually contained a new element, which he proposed calling kali.[17] In 1807, Humphry Davy produced the element via electrolysis: in 1809, Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert proposed the name Kalium for Davy's \"potassium\".[18] In 1814, the Swedish chemist Berzelius advocated the name kalium for potassium, with the chemical symbol K.[19] The English and French-speaking countries adopted the name Potassium, which was favored by Davy and French chemists Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard, whereas the other Germanic countries adopted Gilbert and Klaproth's name Kalium.[20] The \"Gold Book\" of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has designated the official chemical symbol as K.[21]\n\n### Physical\nPotassium is the second least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut with a knife. Potassium is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air.[22] In a flame test, potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.[23] Neutral potassium atoms have 19 electrons, one more than the configuration of the noble gas argon. Because of its low first ionization energy of 418.8 kJ/mol, the potassium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge, although negatively charged alkalide K− ions are not impossible.[24] In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (3052 kJ/mol).\n\n### Chemical\nPotassium reacts with oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide components in air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide. With water potassium forms potassium hydroxide (KOH). The reaction of potassium with water can be violently exothermic, especially since the coproduced hydrogen gas can ignite. Because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium–potassium (NaK) alloy are potent desiccants, although they are no longer used as such.[25]\n\n### Compounds\nFour oxides of potassium are well studied: potassium oxide (K2O), potassium peroxide (K2O2), potassium superoxide (KO2)[26] and potassium ozonide (KO3). The binary potassium-oxygen compounds react with water forming KOH. KOH is a strong base. Illustrating its hydrophilic character, as much as 1.21 kg of KOH can dissolve in a single liter of water.[27][28] Anhydrous KOH is rarely encountered. KOH reacts readily with carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce potassium carbonate (K2CO3), and in principle could be used to remove traces of the gas from air. Like the closely related sodium hydroxide, KOH reacts with fats to produce soaps. In general, potassium compounds are ionic and, owing to the high hydration energy of the K+ ion, have excellent water solubility. The main species in water solution are the aquo complexes [K(H2O)n]+ where n = 6 and 7.[29] Potassium heptafluorotantalate (K2[TaF7]) is an intermediate in the purification of tantalum from the otherwise persistent contaminant of niobium.[30] Organopotassium compounds illustrate nonionic compounds of potassium. They feature highly polar covalent K–C bonds. Examples include benzyl potassium KCH2C6H5. Potassium intercalates into graphite to give a variety of graphite intercalation compounds, including KC8.\n\n### Isotopes\nThere are 25 known isotopes of potassium, three of which occur naturally: 39K (93.3%), 40K (0.0117%), and 41K (6.7%) (by mole fraction). Naturally occurring 40K has a half-life of 1.250×109 years. It decays to stable 40Ar by electron capture or positron emission (11.2%) or to stable 40Ca by beta decay (88.8%).[31] The decay of 40K to 40Ar is the basis of a common method for dating rocks. The conventional K-Ar dating method depends on the assumption that the rocks contained no argon at the time of formation and that all the subsequent radiogenic argon (40Ar) was quantitatively retained. Minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic 40Ar that has accumulated. The minerals best suited for dating include biotite, muscovite, metamorphic hornblende, and volcanic feldspar; whole rock samples from volcanic flows and shallow instrusives can also be dated if they are unaltered.[31][32] Apart from dating, potassium isotopes have been used as tracers in studies of weathering and for nutrient cycling studies because potassium is a macronutrient required for life[33] on Earth. 40K occurs in natural potassium (and thus in some commercial salt substitutes) in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations. 40K is the radioisotope with the largest abundance in the human body. In healthy animals and people, 40K represents the largest source of radioactivity, greater even than 14C. In a human body of 70 kg, about 4,400 nuclei of 40K decay per second.[34] The activity of natural potassium is 31 Bq/g.[35]\n\n### Potash\nPotash is primarily a mixture of potassium salts because plants have little or no sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, its composition was not understood. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702,[14] and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736.[36] The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.[37][38] For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate.[39] Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps.[15] The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium[40] caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale.[41][42][43] Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.[44][45]\n\n### Metal\nPotassium metal was first isolated in 1807 by Humphry Davy, who derived it by electrolysis of molten caustic potash (KOH) with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.[46] Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different.[37][38][47][48] Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, it took some time before this view was universally accepted.[38] Because of the sensitivity of potassium to water and air, air-free techniques are ",

    "content": "### Natural Abundances Of Micronutrients\nThe natural abundance of elements is dependent on their atomic number based on the process of nucleosynthesis such that elements with higher atomic numbers are typically less abundant than elements with low atomic numbers.[17] Most micronutrients are trace elements with high atomic numbers, meaning they exist naturally in low concentrations.[18] Notable exceptions to this rule are boron (atomic no. 5), manganese (atomic no. 25), and iron (atomic no. 26). Primary producers are the main contributors to the incorporation of micronutrients into a community's chemical inventory.[19] Consumers within an ecosystem are limited to the micronutrients in the tissue of the primary producers which they eat. Primary producers obtain their micronutrients from their surrounding abiotic environment and the recycling of organic matter in soils.[20] For example, grasses take in iron from soils which animals rely upon for hemoglobin production.[21]\n\n### Natural Cycling\nThe original source of most nutrients, including micronutrients, is the geological reservoir, also called the slow pool.[27] Micronutrients trapped in rocks and minerals must first be broken down through physical or chemical weathering before they can enter the fast pool, meaning they cycle between reservoirs on shorter timescales.[28] Micronutrients can physically exchange between reservoirs in various ways such as from terrestrial soils to oceans via aeolian transport or fluvial transport, from oceans to marine sediments via deposition of organic matter, and from sediments to the geologic reservoir via lithification.[28][8][12] Alternatively, micronutrients can exit the geologic reservoir through tectonic processes such as through volcanism or hydrothermal vents.[29][30]\n\n### Anthropogenic Influences\nAnthropogenic industry unintentionally injects micronutrients into various ecosystems across the globe.[15] The addition of micronutrients into ecosystems can have both positive and negative impacts. In the face of climate change, the fertilization of oceans with iron has been proposed as a method of carbon sequestration;[31] however, elevated levels of iron in high nutrient, low chlorophyll regions of the ocean can cause the production of harmful algal blooms which are toxic to both humans and marine life.[32] Similarly, in lakes, isolated seas, and coastal bays or gulfs, addition of micronutrients can cause eutrophication leading to hypoxia, decreasing ecosystem health.[33] Micronutrients are released into ecosystems from many anthropogenic activities. Fossil fuel combustion releases micronutrients such as Zn, Fe, Ni, and Cu into the atmosphere, surrounding soils, and nearby waterways.[16] Agricultural fertilizer runoff contains many micronutrients like Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, B, Mo and Ni. Fertilizer runoff injects these micronutrients into groundwater, soils, and waterways.[34] Deforestation decreases soil compaction, resulting in increased aeolian transport of dust containing micronutrients, especially Fe.[12] Industrial mining produces tailings which contaminates runoff. The improper treatment of mining tailings can result in the leakage of micronutrients into groundwater, soils, and nearby waterways.[14][35]\n\n### Human Micronutrient Deficiencies\nInadequate intake of essential nutrients predisposes humans to various chronic diseases, with some 50% of American adults having one or more preventable disease.[2] In the United States, foods poor in micronutrient content and high in food energy make up some 27% of daily calorie intake.[2] One US national survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006) found that persons with high sugar intake consumed fewer micronutrients, especially vitamins A, C, and E, and magnesium.[2] Various strategies have been employed to combat micronutrient deficiencies:\n\n### Salt Iodization\nSalt iodization is a strategy for addressing iodine deficiency, which is a cause of several physical and mental health problems.[36] In 1990, less than 20 percent of households in developing countries had adequate iodine in their diet.[37] By 1994, international partnerships had formed in a global campaign for Universal Salt Iodization. By 2008, it was estimated that 72 percent of households in developing countries included iodized salt in their diets,[38] and the number of countries in which iodine deficiency disorders were a public health concern reduced by more than half from 110 to 47 countries.[37]\n\n### Vitamin A Supplementation\nVitamin A deficiency is a major factor in causing blindness worldwide, particularly among children.[1] Global vitamin A supplementation efforts have targeted 103 priority countries. Flour fortification has become an increasingly common method by which vitamin A can be added to diets thus reducing deficiencies.[39]\n\n### Zinc\nZinc is a necessary micronutrient which the human body uses to fight infections and childhood diarrhea. Collectively, zinc deficiencies are responsible for 4% of child morbidity and mortality, as of 2013.[40] Fortification of staple foods such as breads may improve serum zinc levels in the human population, increasing immune strength.[41] Zinc fortification has also been considered for reducing effects cognition, though the effectiveness is still under research.[41]\n\n### Plant Micronutrient Needs\nPlants rely on micronutrients to build many essential proteins. In fact, every process that supports the growth of a plant is mediated by some protein which contains one of the many micronutrients.[42] For example, Mn is an essential micronutrient for many plants because it builds the structure of photosystem II which splits water molecules to harness energy from electrons.[43] Inadequate micronutrient uptake can result in deficiencies and even mortality in extreme cases.[44] Alternatively, elevated concentrations of micronutrients in soils can result in toxicity.[44] Polyphenol oxidase Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase Cytochrome c oxidase Succinate dehydrogenase Cytochromes Nitrite reductase Malic enzyme Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase Allantoate amidohydrolase Sulfite oxidase Aldehyde oxidase Xanthine dehydrogenase Ni-chaperone Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase Peptide deformylase Matrix metalloproteinase Examples of Plant Micronutrient Deficiencies",

    "title": "Vermicompost",
    "content": "### Overview\nVermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because, as compared with conventional composting, it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly. In manure composing, the use of vermicomposting generates products that have lower salinity levels,[6][7] as well as a more neutral pH.[7] The earthworm species (or composting worms) most often used are red wigglers (Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei), though European nightcrawlers (Eisenia hortensis, synonym Dendrobaena veneta) and red earthworm (Lumbricus rubellus) could also be used.[8] Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers. Containing water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb.[3] Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a \"living\" soil environment for plants.[9] The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the drilosphere.[10] Vermicomposting is a common practice in permaculture.[11][12] Vermiwash can also be obtained from the liquid potion of vermicompost. Vermiwash is found to contain enzyme cocktail of proteases, amylases, urease and phosphatase. Microbiological study of vermiwash reveals that it contains nitrogen-fixing bacteria like Azotobactrer sp., Agrobacterium sp. and Rhizobium sp. and some phosphate solublizing bacteria. Laboratory scale trial shows effectiveness of vermiwash on plant growth.[13]\n\n### Suitable Worm Species\nAll worms make compost but some species are not suitable for this purpose. Vermicompost worms are generally epigean. Species most often used for composting include: These species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout Europe and North America and live in rotting vegetation, compost, and manure piles. As they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil, they adapt easily to live on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin. Some species are considered invasive in some areas, so they should be avoided (see earthworms as invasive species for a list).[1][15] Composting worms are available to order online, from nursery mail-order suppliers or angling shops where they are sold as bait. They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water. The following species are not recommended:\n\n### Large Scale\nLarge-scale vermicomposting is practiced in New Zealand, Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States.[17] The vermicompost may be used for farming, horticulture, market gardening, landscaping, to create compost tea, or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting. There are two main methods of large-scale vermicomposting, windrow composting and raised bed. Some systems use a windrow, which consists of organic feedstock for the earthworms to feed on. Earthworms will move into the windrows and remain within them as long as conditions are favourable; typically involving a balanced mix of feedstock, appropriate moisture content and a comfortable temperature. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to control and manage leachate. The world's largest vermicomposting operation by volume is MyNoke, a New Zealand-based operation that's processed over 1.4 million tonnes of organic waste since establishment in 2007.[18] Windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste.[19] The second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of \"worm chow\" across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed. Because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.\n\n### Small Scale\nFor vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, Styrofoam, or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms. Some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release heavy metals into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material.[20] Some cedars, yellow cedar, and redwood contain resinous oils that may harm worms,[21] although western red cedar has excellent longevity in composting conditions. Hemlock is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins.[22] Bins need holes or mesh for aeration. Some people add a spout or holes in the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection.[23] The most common materials used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and wood.[24] Worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced. Small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality soil amendments, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that bin composting requires. Composting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler Eisenia fetida, are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as Lumbricus terrestris are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system.[25] Other soil species that contribute include insects, other worms and molds.[26]\n\n### Climate And Temperature\nThere may be differences in vermicomposting method depending on the climate.[27] It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high heat-retentive properties), as the raw materials or feedstocks used can compost, heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms. The most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (Eisenia fetida, Eisenia andrei, and Lumbricus rubellus) feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25 °C (59–77 °F). They can survive at 10 °C (50 °F). Temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) may harm them.[28] This temperature range means that indoor vermicomposting with redworms is possible in all but tropical climates. Other worms like Perionyx excavatus are suitable for warmer climates.[29] If a worm bin is kept outside, it should be placed in a sheltered position away from direct sunlight and insulated against frost in winter.\n\n### Feedstock\nThere are few food wastes that vermicomposting cannot compost, although meat waste and dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract vermin. Green waste should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bi",

    "title": "Biochar",
    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word \"biochar\" is a late-20th century English neologism derived from the Greek word 'βίος' (bios, 'life') and 'char' (charcoal produced by carbonization of biomass).[9] It is recognized as charcoal that participates in biological processes found in soil, aquatic habitats, and animal digestive systems.[citation needed]\n\n### History\nPre-Columbian Amazonians produced biochar by smoldering agricultural waste (i.e., covering burning biomass with soil)[10] in pits or trenches.[11] It is not known if they intentionally used biochar to enhance soil productivity.[11] European settlers called it terra preta de Indio.[12] Following observations and experiments, one research team working in French Guiana hypothesized that the Amazonian earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus was the main agent of fine powdering and incorporation of charcoal debris in the mineral soil.[13]\n\n### Production\nBiochar is a high-carbon, fine-grained residue that is produced via pyrolysis. It is the direct thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen, which prevents combustion, and produces a mixture of solids (biochar), liquid (bio-oil), and gas (syngas) products.[14]\n\n### Gasification\nGasifiers produce most of the biochar sold in the United States.[15] The gasification process consists of four main stages: oxidation, drying, pyrolysis, and reduction.[16] Temperature during pyrolysis in gasifiers is 250–550 °C (523–823 K), 600–800 °C (873–1,073 K) in the reduction zone, and 800–1,000 °C (1,070–1,270 K) in the combustion zone.[17] The specific yield from pyrolysis (the step of gasification that produces biochar) is dependent on process conditions such as temperature, heating rate, and residence time.[18] These parameters can be tuned to produce either more energy or more biochar.[19] Temperatures of 400–500 °C (673–773 K) produce more char, whereas temperatures above 700 °C (973 K) favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components.[20] Pyrolysis occurs more quickly at higher temperatures, typically requiring seconds rather than hours. The increasing heating rate leads to a decrease in biochar yield, while the temperature is in the range of 350–600 °C (623–873 K).[21] Typical yields are 60% bio-oil, 20% biochar, and 20% syngas. By comparison, slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char (≈35%);[20] this contributes to soil fertility. Once initialized, both processes produce net energy. For typical inputs, the energy required to run a \"fast\" pyrolyzer is approximately 15% of the energy that it outputs.[22] Pyrolysis plants can use the syngas output and yield 3–9 times the amount of energy required to run.[11] The Amazonian pit/trench method,[11] in contrast, harvests neither bio-oil nor syngas, and releases CO2, black carbon, and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) (and potentially, toxicants) into the air, though less greenhouse gasses than captured during the growth of the biomass.[citation needed] Commercial-scale systems process agricultural waste, paper byproducts, and even municipal waste and typically eliminate these side effects by capturing and using the liquid and gas products.[23][24] The 2018 winner of the X Prize Foundation for atmospheric water generators harvests potable water from the drying stage of the gasification process.[25][26] The production of biochar as an output is not a priority in most cases.[citation needed]\n\n### Small-Scale Methods\nSmallholder farmers in developing countries easily produce their own biochar without special equipment. They make piles of crop waste (e.g., maize stalks, rice straw, or wheat straw), light the piles on the top, and quench the embers with dirt or water to make biochar. This method greatly reduces smoke compared to traditional methods of burning crop waste. This method is known as the top-down burn or conservation burn.[27][28][29] Alternatively, more industrial methods can be used on small scales. While in a centralized system, unused biomass is brought to a central plant for processing into biochar,[30] it is also possible for each farmer or group of farmers to operate a kiln.[citation needed] In this scenario, a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer moves from place to place to pyrolyze biomass. Vehicle power comes from the syngas stream, while the biochar remains on the farm. The biofuel is sent to a refinery or storage site. Factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts, the amount of material to be processed, and the ability to supply the power grid.[citation needed] Various companies in North America, Australia, and England also sell biochar or biochar production units. In Sweden, the 'Stockholm Solution' is an urban tree planting system that uses 30% biochar to support urban forest growth.[31] At the 2009 International Biochar Conference, a mobile pyrolysis unit with a specified intake of 1,000 pounds (450 kg) was introduced for agricultural applications.[32]\n\n### Crops Used\nCommon crops used for making biochar include various tree species, as well as various energy crops. Some of these energy crops (i.e. Napier grass) can store much more carbon on a shorter timespan than trees do.[33] For crops that are not exclusively for biochar production, the residue-to-product ratio (RPR) and the collection factor (CF), the percent of the residue not used for other things, measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained. For instance, Brazil harvests approximately 460 million tons (MT) of sugarcane annually,[34] with an RPR of 0.30, and a CF of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops, which normally are burned in the field.[35] This translates into approximately 100 MT of residue annually, which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives. Adding in the bagasse (sugarcane waste) (RPR=0.29, CF=1.0), which is otherwise burned (inefficiently) in boilers, raises the total to 230 MT of pyrolysis feedstock. Some plant residue, however, must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers.[36]\n\n### Hydrochar\nBesides pyrolysis, torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization processes can also thermally decompose biomass to the solid material. However, these products cannot be strictly defined as biochar. The carbon product from the torrefaction process contains some volatile organic components; thus its properties are between that of biomass feedstock and biochar.[37] And although hydrothermal carbonization can produce a carbon-rich solid product, the process is evidently different from the conventional thermal conversion process,[38] so the product is therefore defined as \"hydrochar\" rather than \"biochar\".\n\n### Thermo-Catalytic Depolymerization\nThermo-catalytic depolymerization is another method to produce biochar, which utilizes microwaves. It has been used to efficiently convert organic matter to biochar on an industrial scale, producing about 50% char.[39][40]\n\n### Properties\nThe physical and chemical properties of biochars as determined by feedstocks and technologies are crucial. Characterization data explain their performance in a specific use. For example, guidelines published by the International Biochar Initiative provide standardized evaluation methods.[14] Properties can be categorized in several respects, including the proximate and elemental composition, pH value, and porosity. The atomic ratios of biochar, including H/C and O/C, correlate with the properties that are relevant to organic content, such as polarity and aromaticity.[41] A van-Krevelen diagram can show the evolution of biochar atomic ratios in the production process.[42] In the carbonization process, both the H/C and O/C atomic ratios decrease due to the release of functional groups that contain hydrogen and oxygen.[43] Production temperatures influence biochar properties in several ways. The molecular carbon structure of the solid biochar matrix is particularly affected. Initial pyrolysis at 450–550 °C leaves an amorphous carb",

    "content": "### History\nPrior to the widespread use of herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds.[7] Mechanical control including tillage and flooding were also used to control weeds. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, inorganic chemicals such as sulfuric acid, arsenic, copper salts, kerosene and sodium chlorate were used to control weeds, but these chemicals were either toxic, flammable or corrosive and were expensive and ineffective at controlling weeds.[8][9]\n\n### First Herbicides\nThe major breakthroughs occurred during the Second World War as the result of research conducted independently in the United Kingdom and the United States into the potential use of herbicides in war.[10] The compound 2,4-D was first synthesized by W. G. Templeman at Imperial Chemical Industries. In 1940, his work with indoleacetic acid and naphthaleneacetic acid indicated that \"growth substances applied appropriately would kill certain broad-leaved weeds in cereals without harming the crops,\"[11][12] though these substances were too expensive and too short-lived in soil due to degradation by microorganisms to be of practical agricultural use; by 1941, his team succeeded in synthesizing a wide range of chemicals to achieve the same effect at lower cost and better efficacy, including 2,4-D.[13] In the same year, R. Pokorny in the US achieved this as well.[14] Independently, a team under Juda Hirsch Quastel, working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station made the same discovery. Quastel was tasked by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) to discover methods for improving crop yield. By analyzing soil as a dynamic system, rather than an inert substance, he was able to apply techniques such as perfusion. Quastel was able to quantify the influence of various plant hormones, inhibitors, and other chemicals on the activity of microorganisms in the soil and assess their direct impact on plant growth. While the full work of the unit remained secret, certain discoveries were developed for commercial use after the war, including the 2,4-D compound.[15] When 2,4-D was commercially released in 1946, it became the first successful selective herbicide, triggering a worldwide revolution in agricultural output. It allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal grass crops, because it kills dicots (broadleaf plants), but not most monocots (grasses). The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today, and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world.[16] Like other acid herbicides, current formulations use either an amine salt (often trimethylamine) or one of many esters of the parent compound.\n\n### Further Discoveries\nThe triazine family of herbicides, which includes atrazine, was introduced in the 1950s; they have the current distinction of being the herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination. Atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above-neutral pH. Under alkaline soil conditions, atrazine may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination. Atrazine is thus said to have \"carryover\", a generally undesirable property for herbicides. Glyphosate had been first prepared in the 1950s but its herbicidal activity was only recognized in the 1960s. It was marketed as Roundup in 1971.[17] The development of glyphosate-resistant crop plants, it is now used very extensively for selective weed control in growing crops. The pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s. Many modern herbicides used in agriculture and gardening are specifically formulated to degrade within a short period after application.\n\n### Terminology\nHerbicides can be classified/grouped in various ways; for example, according to their activity, the timing of application, method of application, mechanism of their action, and their chemical structures.\n\n### Selectivity\nChemical structure of the herbicide is of primary affecting efficacy. 2,4-D, mecoprop, and dicamba control many broadleaf weeds but remain ineffective against turf grasses.[18] Chemical additives influence selectivity. Surfactants alter the physical properties of the spray solution and the overall phytotoxicity of the herbicide, increasing translocation. Herbicide safeners enhance the selectivity by boosting herbicide resistance by the crop but allowing the herbicide to damage the weed. Selectivity is determined by the circumstances and technique of application. Climatic factors affect absorption including humidity, light, precipitation, and temperature. Foliage-applied herbicides will enter the leaf more readily at high humidity by lengthening the drying time of the spray droplet and increasing cuticle hydration. Light of high intensity may break down some herbicides and cause the leaf cuticle to thicken, which can interfere with absorption. Precipitation may wash away or remove some foliage-applied herbicides, but it will increase root absorption of soil-applied herbicides. Drought-stressed plants are less likely to translocate herbicides. As temperature increases, herbicides' performance may decrease. Absorption and translocation may be reduced in very cold weather.\n\n### Non-Selective Herbicides\nNon-selective herbicides, generally known as defoliants, are used to clear industrial sites, waste grounds, railways, and railway embankments. Paraquat, glufosinate, and glyphosate are non-selective herbicides.[18]\n\n### Persistence\nAn herbicide is described as having low residual activity if it is neutralized within a short time of application (within a few weeks or months) – typically this is due to rainfall, or reactions in the soil. A herbicide described as having high residual activity will remain potent for the long term in the soil. For some compounds, the residual activity can leave the ground almost permanently barren.[19]\n\n### Mechanism Of Action\nHerbicides interfere with the biochemical machinery that supports plant growth. Herbicides often mimic natural plant hormones, enzyme substrates, and cofactors. They interfere with the metabolism in the target plants. Herbicides are often classified according to their site of action because as a general rule, herbicides within the same site of action class produce similar symptoms on susceptible plants. Classification based on the site of action of the herbicide is preferable as herbicide resistance management can be handled more effectively.[18] Classification by mechanism of action (MOA) indicates the first enzyme, protein, or biochemical step affected in the plant following application: Complementary to mechanism-based classifications, herbicides are often classified according to their chemical structures or motifs. Similar structural types work in similar ways. For example, aryloxyphenoxypropionates herbicides (diclofop chlorazifop, fluazifop) appear to all act as ACCase inhibitors.[20] The so-called cyclohexanedione herbicides, which are used against grasses, include the following commercial products cycloxydim, clethodim, tralkoxydim, butroxydim, sethoxydim, profoxydim, and mesotrione.[27] Knowing about herbicide chemical family grouping serves as a short-term strategy for managing resistance to site of action.[28] The  phenoxyacetic acid mimic the natural auxin indoleacetic acid (IAA). This family includes MCPA, 2,4-D, and 2,4,5-T, picloram, dicamba, clopyralid, and triclopyr.\n\n### Wssa And Hrac Classification\nUsing the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) and herbicide Resistance and World Grains (HRAC) systems, herbicides are classified by mode of action.[29] Eventually the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC)[30] and the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA)[31] developed a classification system.[32][33] Groups in ",

    "explanation": "### History\nPrior to the widespread use of herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds.[7] Mechanical control including tillage and flooding were also used to control weeds. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, inorganic chemicals such as sulfuric acid, arsenic, copper salts, kerosene and sodium chlorate were used to control weeds, but these chemicals were either toxic, flammable or corrosive and were expensive and inef",

    "content": "### Sales\nIn 2016 insecticides were estimated to account for 18% of worldwide pesticide sales.[2] Worldwide sales of insecticides in 2018 were estimated as $ 18.4 billion, of which 25% were neonicotinoids, 17% were pyrethroids, 13% were diamides, and the rest were many other classes which sold for less than 10% each of the market.[3]\n\n### Synthetic Insecticides\nInsecticides are most usefully categorised according to their modes of action. The insecticide resistance action committee (IRAC) lists 30 modes of action plus unknowns. There can be several chemical classes of insecticide with the same mode or action. IRAC lists 56 chemical classes plus unknowns.[4] The mode of action describes how the insecticide kills or inactivates a pest.\n\n### Development\nInsecticides with systemic activity against sucking pests, which are safe to pollinators, are sought after,[5][6][7] particularly in view of the partial bans on neonicotinoids. Revised 2023 guidance by registration authorities describes the bee testing that is required for new insecticides to be approved for commercial use.[8][9][10][11]\n\n### Systemicity And Translocation\nInsecticides may be systemic or non-systemic (contact insecticides).[2][12][13] Systemic insecticides penetrate into the plant and move (translocate) inside the plant. Translocation may be upward in the xylem, or downward in the phloem or both. Systemicity is a prerequisite for the pesticide to be used as a seed-treatment. Contact insecticides (non-systemic insecticides) remain on the leaf surface and act through direct contact with the insect. Insects feed from various compartments in the plant. Most of the major pests are either chewing insects or sucking insects.[14] Chewing insects, such as caterpillars, eat whole pieces of leaf. Sucking insects use feeding tubes to feed from phloem (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers, scales and whiteflies), or to suck cell contents (e.g. thrips and mites). An insecticide is more effective if it is in the compartment the insect feeds from. The physicochemical properties of the insecticide determine how it is distributed throughout the plant.[12][13]\n\n### Organochlorides\nThe first and best known organochloride, DDT, was first synthesised by Othmar Zeidler. Swiss scientist Paul Müller found DDTs insecticide properties. For this discovery, he was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.[15] DDT was introduced in 1944. It functions by opening sodium channels in the insect's nerve cells.[16] The contemporaneous rise of the chemical industry facilitated large-scale production of chlorinated hydrocarbons including various cyclodiene and hexachlorocyclohexane compounds. Although commonly used in the past, many older chemicals have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects (e.g. DDT, chlordane, and toxaphene).[17][18]\n\n### Organophosphates\nOrganophosphates are another large class of contact insecticides.  These also target the insect's nervous system. Organophosphates interfere with the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and other cholinesterases, causing an increase in synaptic acetylcholine and overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system,[19] killing or disabling the insect. Organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (such as sarin, tabun, soman, and VX) have the same mechanism of action. Organophosphates have a cumulative toxic effect to wildlife, so multiple exposures to the chemicals amplifies the toxicity.[20] In the US, organophosphate use declined with the rise of substitutes.[21] Many of these insecticides, first developed in the mid 20th century, are very poisonous.[22] Many organophosphates do not persist in the environment.\n\n### Pyrethroids\nPyrethroid insecticides mimic the insecticidal activity of the natural compound pyrethrin, the biopesticide found in Pyrethrum (Now Chrysanthemum and Tanacetum) species. They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment. These compounds are nonpersistent sodium channel modulators and are less toxic than organophosphates and carbamates. Compounds in this group are often applied against household pests.[23] Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.[24]\n\n### Neonicotinoids\nNeonicotinoids are a class of neuro-active insecticides chemically similar to nicotine, with much lower acute mammalian toxicity and greater field persistence. These chemicals are acetylcholine receptor agonists. They are broad-spectrum systemic insecticides, with rapid action (minutes-hours). They are applied as sprays, drenches, seed and soil treatments. Treated insects exhibit leg tremors, rapid wing motion, stylet withdrawal (aphids), disoriented movement, paralysis and death.[25]Imidacloprid, of the neonicotinoid family, is the most widely used insecticide in the world.[26] In the late 1990s neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impact and were linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34] and its potential to increase the susceptibility of rice to planthopper attacks.[35]\n\n### Diamides\nDiamides selectively activate insect ryanodine receptors (RyR), which are large calcium release channels present in cardiac and skeletal muscle,[36] leading to the loss of calcium crucial for biological processes. This causes insects to act lethargic, stop feeding, and eventually die.[37] The first insecticide from this class to be registered was flubendiamide.[37]\n\n### Definition\nThe EU defines biopesticides as \"a form of pesticide based on micro-organisms or natural products\".[38] The US EPA defines biopesticides as “certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals”.[39] Microorganisms that control pests may also be categorised as biological pest control agents together with larger organisms such as parasitic insects, entomopathic nematodes etc. Natural products may also be categorised as chemical insecticides. The US EPA describes three types of biopesticide.[39] Biochemical pesticides (meaning bio-derived chemicals), which are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms. Microbial pesticides consisting of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient. Plant-Incorporated-Protectants (PIPs) are pesticidal substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant (thus producing transgenic crops).\n\n### Market\nThe global bio-insecticide market was estimated to be less than 10% of the total insecticide market.[40] The bio-insecticide market is dominated by microbials.[41] The bio-insecticide market is growing more that 10% yearly, which is a higher growth than the total insecticide market, mainly due to the increase in organic farming and IPM, and also due to benevolent government policies.[40] Biopesticides are regarded by the US and European authorities as posing fewer risks of environmental and mammalian toxicity.[39] Biopesticides are more than 10 x (often 100 x) cheaper and 3 x faster to register than synthetic pesticides.[40]\n\n### Advantages And Disadvantages\nThere is a wide variety of biological insecticides with differing attributes, but in general the following has been described.[42][43] They are easier, faster and cheaper to register, usually with lower mammalian toxicity. They are more specific, and thus preserve beneficial insects and biodiversity in general. This makes them compatible with IPM regimes. They degrade rapidly cause less impact on the environment. They have a shorter withholding period.[citation needed] The spectrum of control is narrow. They are less effective and prone to adverse ambient conditions. They degrade rapidly and are",

    "content": "### Major Fungi In Agriculture\nSome major fungal threats to agriculture (and the associated diseases) are Ascomycetes (such as powdery mildew), basidiomycetes (various rust fungi), deuteromycetes (such as anthracnose), and oomycetes (such as downy mildew).[1]\n\n### Types Of Fungicides\nLike other pesticides, fungicides are numerous and diverse. This complexity has led to diverse schemes for classifying fungicides.  Classifications are based on inorganic (elemental sulfur and copper salts) vs organic, chemical structures (dithiocarbamates vs phthalimides), and, most successfully, mechanism of action (MOA). These respective classifications reflect the evolution of the underlying science.\n\n### Traditional\nTraditional fungicides are simple inorganic compounds like sulfur,[5] and copper salts. While cheap, they must be applied repeatedly and are relatively ineffective.[2] Other active ingredients in fungicides include neem oil, rosemary oil, jojoba oil, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and the beneficial fungus Ulocladium oudemansii.\n\n### Nonspecific\nIn the 1930s dithiocarbamate-based fungicides, the first organic compounds used for this purpose, became available.  These include ferbam, ziram, zineb, maneb, and mancozeb.  These compounds are non-specific and are thought to inhibit cysteine-based protease enzymes.  Similarly nonspecific are N-substituted phthalimides.  Members include captafol, captan, and folpet.  Chlorothalonil is also non-specific.[2]\n\n### Specific\nSpecific fungicides target a particular biological process in the fungus.\n\n### Respiration\nSome fungicides target succinate dehydrogenase, a metabolically central enzyme.  Fungi of the class Basidiomycetes were the initial focus of these fungicides.  These fungi are active against cereals.\n\n### Mycoviruses\nSome of the most common fungal crop pathogens are known to suffer from mycoviruses, and it is likely that they are as common as for plant and animal viruses, although not as well studied. Given the obligately parasitic nature of mycoviruses, it is likely that all of these are detrimental to their hosts, and thus are potential biocontrols/biofungicides.[7]\n\n### Resistance\nDoses that provide the most control of the disease also provide the largest selection pressure to acquire resistance.[8] In some cases, the pathogen evolves resistance to multiple fungicides, a phenomenon known as cross resistance. These additional fungicides typically belong to the same chemical family, act in the same way, or have a similar mechanism for detoxification. Sometimes negative cross-resistance occurs, where resistance to one chemical class of fungicides increases sensitivity to a different chemical class of fungicides. This has been seen with carbendazim and diethofencarb. Also possible is resistance to two chemically different fungicides by separate mutation events. For example, Botrytis cinerea is resistant to both azoles and dicarboximide fungicides. A common mechanism for acquiring resistance is alteration of the target enzyme. For example, Black Sigatoka, an economically important pathogen of banana, is resistant to the QoI fungicides, due to a single nucleotide change resulting in the replacement of one amino acid (glycine) by another (alanine) in the target protein of the QoI fungicides, cytochrome b.[9] It is presumed that this disrupts the binding of the fungicide to the protein, rendering the fungicide ineffective. Upregulation of target genes can also render the fungicide ineffective. This is seen in DMI-resistant strains of Venturia inaequalis.[10] Resistance to fungicides can also be developed by efficient efflux of the fungicide out of the cell. Septoria tritici has developed multiple drug resistance using this mechanism. The pathogen had five ABC-type transporters with overlapping substrate specificities that together work to pump toxic chemicals out of the cell.[11] In addition to the mechanisms outlined above, fungi may also develop metabolic pathways that circumvent the target protein, or acquire enzymes that enable the metabolism of the fungicide to a harmless substance. Fungicides that are at risk of losing their potency due to resistance include Strobilurins such as azoxystrobin.[12]\n\n### Fungicide Resistance Management\nCross-resistance can occur because the active ingredients share a common mode of action. The industry-sponsored Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), whose parent organization is CropLife International,[13] advises on the use of fungicides in crop protection and classifies the available compounds according to their chemical structures and mechanism of action so as to manage the risks of resistance developing.[14] The 2024 FRAC poster of fungicides includes all the chemicals mentioned in this article.[15]\n\n### Safety\nFungicides pose risks for humans.[16] Fungicide residues have been found on food for human consumption, mostly from post-harvest treatments.[17] Some fungicides are dangerous to human health, such as vinclozolin, which has now been removed from use.[18] Ziram is also a fungicide that is toxic to humans with long-term exposure, and fatal if ingested.[19]  A number of fungicides are also used in human health care.",

    "title": "Rodenticide",
    "content": "### Anticoagulants\nAnticoagulants are defined as chronic (death occurs one to two weeks after ingestion of the lethal dose, rarely sooner), single-dose (second generation) or multiple-dose (first generation) rodenticides, acting by effective blocking of the vitamin-K cycle, resulting in inability to produce essential blood-clotting factors—mainly coagulation factors II (prothrombin) and VII (proconvertin).[2][8] In addition to this specific metabolic disruption, massive toxic doses of 4-hydroxycoumarin, 4-thiochromenone and 1,3-indandione anticoagulants cause damage to tiny blood vessels (capillaries), increasing their permeability, causing internal bleeding. These effects are gradual, developing over several days. In the final phase of the intoxication, the exhausted rodent collapses due to hemorrhagic shock or severe anemia and dies. The question of whether the use of these rodenticides can be considered humane has been raised.[9] The main benefit of anticoagulants over other poisons is that the time taken for the poison to induce death means that the rats do not associate the damage with their feeding habits. These are harder to group by generation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers chlorophacinone and diphacinone as first generation agents.[13] According to some sources, the indandiones are considered second generation.[16] Phylloquinone has been suggested, and successfully used, as antidote for pets or humans accidentally or intentionally exposed to anticoagulant poisons.  Some of these poisons act by inhibiting liver functions and in advanced stages of poisoning, several blood-clotting factors are absent, and the volume of circulating blood is diminished, so that a blood transfusion (optionally with the clotting factors present) can save a person who has been poisoned, an advantage over some older poisons. A unique enzyme produced by the liver enables the body to recycle vitamin K. To produce the blood clotting factors that prevent excessive bleeding, the body needs vitamin K. Anticoagulants hinder this enzyme's ability to function. Internal bleeding could start if the body's reserve of anticoagulant runs out from exposure to enough of it. Because they bind more closely to the enzyme that produces blood clotting agents, single-dose anticoagulants are more hazardous. They may also obstruct several stages of the recycling of vitamin K. Single-dose or second-generation anticoagulants can be stored in the liver because they are not quickly eliminated from the body.[18]\n\n### Metal Phosphides\nMetal phosphides have been used as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1–3 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually zinc phosphide) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate toxic phosphine gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait for a week or two (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2–4 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily). Zinc phosphide is typically added to rodent baits in a concentration of 0.75% to 2.0%. The baits have strong, pungent garlic-like odor due to the phosphine liberated by hydrolysis. The odor attracts (or, at least, does not repel) rodents, but has a repulsive effect on other mammals. Birds, notably wild turkeys, are not sensitive to the smell, and might feed on the bait, and thus fall victim to the poison.[citation needed] The tablets or pellets (usually aluminium, calcium or magnesium phosphide for fumigation/gassing) may also contain other chemicals which evolve ammonia, which helps reduce the potential for spontaneous combustion or explosion of the phosphine gas.[citation needed] Metal phosphides do not accumulate in the tissues of poisoned animals, so the risk of secondary poisoning is low. Before the advent of anticoagulants, phosphides were the favored kind of rat poison. During World War II, they came into use in United States because of shortage of strychnine due to the Japanese occupation of the territories where the strychnine tree is grown. Phosphides are rather fast-acting rat poisons, resulting in the rats dying usually in open areas, instead of in the affected buildings. Phosphides used as rodenticides include:\n\n### Hypercalcemia (Vitamin D Overdose)\nCholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) are used as rodenticides. They are toxic to rodents for the same reason they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few IUs per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins, they are toxic in larger doses, causing hypervitaminosis D. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes hypercalcemia, raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, [CaHCO3]+), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and action potential propagation between the atria and ventricles), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol (30,000 IU/g)[19][20] and 0.1% ergocalciferol (40,000 IU/g) when used alone, which can kill a rodent or a rat. There is an important feature of calciferols toxicology, that they are synergistic with anticoagulant toxicant. In other words, mixtures of anticoagulants and calciferols in same bait are more toxic than a sum of toxicities of the anticoagulant and the calciferol in the bait, so that a massive hypercalcemic effect can be achieved by a substantially lower calciferol content in the bait, and vice versa, a more pronounced anticoagulant/hemorrhagic effects are observed if the calciferol is present. This synergism is mostly used in calciferol low concentration baits, because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive tha",

    "title": "Glyphosate",
    "content": "### Discovery\nGlyphosate was first synthesized in 1950 by Swiss chemist Henry Martin, who worked for the Swiss company Cilag. The work was never published.[20]: 1  Early studies found it to be a weak chemical chelating agent.[21][22] Glyphosate was independently discovered in the United States at Monsanto in 1970. About 100 derivatives of aminomethylphosphonic acid had been prepared as potential water-softening agents. Two were found to have weak herbicidal activity, and John E. Franz, a chemist at Monsanto, was asked to try to make analogs with stronger herbicidal activity. Glyphosate was the third analog he made.[20]: 1–2 [23][24] Franz received the National Medal of Technology of the United States in 1987 and the Perkin Medal for Applied Chemistry in 1990 for his discoveries.[25][26][27] Monsanto developed and patented the use of glyphosate to kill weeds in the early 1970s and first brought it to market in 1974 under the Roundup brandname.[28][29] While its initial patent[30] expired in 1991, Monsanto retained exclusive rights in the United States until its patent[31] on the isopropylamine salt expired in September 2000.[32] In 2008, scientists at the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) described glyphosate as a \"virtually ideal\" herbicide.[28] In 2010 Powles stated: \"glyphosate is a one in a 100-year discovery that is as important for reliable global food production as penicillin is for battling disease.\"[33]\n\n### Chemistry\nGlyphosate is a derivative of aminophosphonic acid and the amino acid glycine. Both the phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties can be ionised (deprotonated) and the amine group can be protonated. Consequently the substance exists as a series of rapidly interchanging zwitterions. It was originally synthesized by the reaction of chloromethylphosphonate with glycine. Its name is a contraction of its constituents: glycine and a phosphonate.[34] The main degradation path for glyphosate is hydrolysis to aminomethylphosphonic acid.[35]\n\n### Synthesis\nTwo main approaches are used to synthesize glyphosate industrially, both of which proceed via the Kabachnik–Fields reaction. The first is to react iminodiacetic acid and formaldehyde with phosphorous acid (sometimes formed in situ from phosphorus trichloride using the water generated by the Mannich reaction of the first two reagents). Decarboxylation of the hydrophosphonylation product gives the desired glyphosate product. Iminodiacetic acid is usually prepared on-site by various methods depending on reagent availability.[20]  The second uses glycine in place of iminodiacetic acid. This avoids the need for decarboxylation but requires more careful control of stoichiometry, as the primary amine can react with any excess formaldehyde to form bishydroxymethylglycine, which must be hydrolysed during the work-up to give the desired product.[20]  This synthetic approach is responsible for a substantial portion of the production of glyphosate in China, with considerable work having gone into recycling the triethylamine and methanol solvents.[20] Progress has also been made in attempting to eliminate the need for triethylamine altogether.[36]\n\n### Impurities\nTechnical grade glyphosate is a white powder that, according to FAO specification, should contain not less than 95% glyphosate. Formaldehyde, classified as a known human carcinogen,\n[37]\n[38]\nand N-nitrosoglyphosate, have been identified as toxicologically relevant impurities.[39] The FAO specification limits the formaldehyde concentration to a maximum of 1.3 g/kg glyphosate. N-Nitrosoglyphosate, \"belonging to a group of impurities of particular concern as they can be activated to genotoxic carcinogens\",[40] should not exceed 1 ppm.[39]\n\n### Formulations\nGlyphosate is marketed in the United States and worldwide by many agrochemical companies in diverse strengths and with diverse adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames.[41][42][43][44] As of 2010, more than 750 glyphosate products were on the market.[45] In 2012, about half of the total global consumption of glyphosate by volume was for agricultural crops,[46] with forestry comprising another important market.[47] Asia and the Pacific was the largest and fastest growing regional market.[46] As of 2014, Chinese manufacturers collectively are the world's largest producers of glyphosate and its precursors[48] and account for about 30% of global exports.[46] Key manufacturers include Anhui Huaxing Chemical Industry Company, BASF, Bayer CropScience (which also acquired the maker of glyphosate, Monsanto), Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, Jiangsu Good Harvest-Weien Agrochemical Company, Nantong Jiangshan Agrochemical & Chemicals Co., Nufarm, SinoHarvest, Syngenta, and Zhejiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Company.[46] Glyphosate is an acid molecule, so it is formulated as a salt for packaging and handling. Various salt formulations include isopropylamine, diammonium, monoammonium, or potassium as the counterion. The active ingredient of the Monsanto herbicides is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate. Another important ingredient in some formulations is the surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA). Some brands include more than one salt. Some companies report their product as acid equivalent (ae) of glyphosate acid, or some report it as active ingredient (ai) of glyphosate plus the salt, and others report both. Given that each salt has its own molecular weight, the acid equivalent is a more accurate method of expressing and comparing concentrations. Adjuvant loading refers to the amount of adjuvant[49][50] already added to the glyphosate product. Fully loaded products contain all the necessary adjuvants, including surfactant; some contain no adjuvant system, while other products contain only a limited amount of adjuvant (minimal or partial loading) and additional surfactants must be added to the spray tank before application.[51] Products are supplied most commonly in formulations of 120, 240, 360, 480, and 680 g/L of active ingredient. The most common formulation in agriculture is 360 g/L, either alone or with added cationic surfactants.[42] For 360 grams per litre (0.013 lb/cu in) formulations, European regulations allow applications of up to 12 litres per hectare (1.1 imp gal/acre) for control of perennial weeds such as couch grass. More commonly, rates of 3 litres per hectare (0.27 imp gal/acre) are practiced for control of annual weeds between crops.[52]\n\n### Mode Of Action\nGlyphosate interferes with the shikimate pathway, which produces the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan in plants and microorganisms[53] – but does not exist in the genome of animals, including humans.[54][21] It blocks this pathway by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which catalyzes the reaction of shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate to form 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP).[55] Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage and minimally through roots, meaning that it is only effective on actively growing plants and cannot prevent seeds from germinating.[56][57] After application, glyphosate is readily transported around the plant to growing roots and leaves and this systemic activity is important for its effectiveness.[28][20] Inhibiting the enzyme causes shikimate to accumulate in plant tissues and diverts energy and resources away from other processes, eventually killing the plant. While growth stops within hours of application, it takes several days for the leaves to begin turning yellow.[58] Glyphosate may chelate Co2+, which contributes to its mode of action.[59][60][61]  Under normal circumstances, EPSP is dephosphorylated to chorismate, an essential precursor for the amino acids mentioned above.[62] These amino acids are used in protein synthesis and to produce secondary metabolites such as folates, ubiquinones, and naphthoquinone.

    "content": "### Properties And Chemistry\nDDT is similar in structure to the insecticide methoxychlor and the acaricide dicofol. It is highly hydrophobic and nearly insoluble in water but has good solubility in most organic solvents, fats and oils. DDT does not occur naturally and is synthesised by consecutive Friedel–Crafts reactions between chloral (CCl3CHO) and two equivalents of chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl), in the presence of an acidic catalyst.[1] DDT has been marketed under trade names including Anofex, Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol, Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron, Ixodex, Neocid, Neocidol and Zerdane; INN is clofenotane.[5]\n\n### Isomers And Related Compounds\nCommercial DDT is a mixture of several closely related compounds. Due to the nature of the chemical reaction used to synthesize DDT, several combinations of ortho and para arene substitution patterns are formed. The major component (77%) is the desired p,p' isomer. The o,p' isomeric impurity is also present in significant amounts (15%). Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) make up the balance of impurities in commercial samples. DDE and DDD are also the major metabolites and environmental breakdown products.[5] DDT, DDE and DDD are sometimes referred to collectively as DDX.[18]\n\n### Production And Use\nDDT has been formulated in multiple forms, including solutions in xylene or petroleum distillates, emulsifiable concentrates, water-wettable powders, granules, aerosols, smoke candles and charges for vaporizers and lotions.[19] From 1950 to 1980, DDT was extensively used in agriculture – more than 40,000 tonnes each year worldwide[20] – and it has been estimated that a total of 1.8 million tonnes have been produced globally since the 1940s.[1] In the United States, it was manufactured by some 15 companies, including Monsanto, Ciba,[21] Montrose Chemical Company, Pennwalt,[22] and Velsicol Chemical Corporation.[23] Production peaked in 1963 at 82,000 tonnes per year.[5] More than 600,000 tonnes (1.35 billion pounds) were applied in the US before the 1972 ban. Usage peaked in 1959 at about 36,000 tonnes.[24] China ceased production in 2007,[25] leaving India the only country still manufacturing DDT; it is the largest consumer.[7] In 2009, 3,314 tonnes were produced for malaria control and visceral leishmaniasis.  In recent years, in addition to India, just seven other countries, all in Africa, are still using DDT.[26]\n\n### Mechanism Of Insecticide Action\nIn insects, DDT opens voltage-sensitive sodium ion channels in neurons, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death.[27] Insects with certain mutations in their sodium channel gene are resistant to DDT and similar insecticides.[27] DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing cytochrome P450 in some insect species,[28] as greater quantities of some enzymes of this group accelerate the toxin's metabolism into inactive metabolites. Genomic studies in the model genetic organism Drosophila melanogaster revealed that high level DDT resistance is polygenic, involving multiple resistance mechanisms.[29] In the absence of genetic adaptation, Roberts and Andre 1994 find behavioral avoidance nonetheless provides insects with some protection against DDT.[30] The M918T mutation event produces dramatic kdr for pyrethroids but Usherwood et al. 2005 find it is entirely ineffective against DDT.[31] Scott 2019 believes this test in Drosophila oocytes holds for oocytes in general.[31]\n\n### History\nDDT was first synthesized in 1874 by Othmar Zeidler under the supervision of Adolf von Baeyer.[32][33] It was further described in 1929 in a dissertation by W. Bausch and in two subsequent publications in 1930.[34][35] The insecticide properties of \"multiple chlorinated aliphatic or fat-aromatic alcohols with at least one trichloromethane group\" were described in a patent in 1934 by Wolfgang von Leuthold.[36] DDT's insecticidal properties were not, however, discovered until 1939 by the Swiss scientist Paul Hermann Müller, who was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his efforts.[6]\n\n### Use In The 1940S And 1950S\nDDT is the best-known of several chlorine-containing pesticides used in the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, the use of DDT was driven by protecting American soldiers from diseases in tropical areas. Both British and American scientists hoped to use it to control spread of malaria, typhus, dysentery, and typhoid fever among overseas soldiers, especially considering that the pyrethrum was harder to access since it came mainly from Japan.[37][38] Due to the potency of DDT, it was not long before America's War Production Board placed it on military supply lists in 1942 and 1943 and encouraged its production for overseas use. Enthusiasm regarding DDT became obvious through the American government's advertising campaigns of posters depicting Americans fighting the Axis powers and insects and through media publications celebrating its military uses.[37] In the South Pacific, it was sprayed aerially for malaria and dengue fever control with spectacular effects. While DDT's chemical and insecticidal properties were important factors in these victories, advances in application equipment coupled with competent organization and sufficient manpower were also crucial to the success of these programs.[39] In 1945, DDT was made available to farmers as an agricultural insecticide[5] and played a role in the elimination of malaria in Europe and North America.[15][40][41] Despite concerns emerging in the scientific community, and lack of research, the FDA considered it safe up to 7 parts per million in food. There was a large economic incentive to push DDT into the market and sell it to farmers, governments, and individuals to control diseases and increase food production.[37] DDT was also a way for American influence to reach abroad through DDT-spraying campaigns. In the 1944 issue of Life magazine there was a feature regarding the Italian program showing pictures of American public health officials in uniforms spraying DDT on Italian families.[37] In 1955, the World Health Organization commenced a program to eradicate malaria in countries with low to moderate transmission rates worldwide, relying largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to reduce transmission.[42] The program eliminated the disease in \"North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union\",[43] and in \"Taiwan, much of the Caribbean, the Balkans, parts of northern Africa, the northern region of Australia, and a large swath of the South Pacific\"[44] and dramatically reduced mortality in Sri Lanka and India.[45] However, failure to sustain the program, increasing mosquito tolerance to DDT, and increasing parasite tolerance led to a resurgence. In many areas early successes partially or completely reversed, and in some cases rates of transmission increased.[13] The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with \"high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission\".[43] DDT was less effective in tropical regions due to the continuous life cycle of mosquitoes and poor infrastructure. It was applied in sub-Saharan Africa by various colonial states, but the 'global' WHO eradication program didn't include the region.[46] Mortality rates in that area never declined to the same dramatic extent, and now constitute the bulk of malarial deaths worldwide, especially following the disease's resurgence as a result of resistance to drug treatments and the spread of the deadly malarial variant caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Eradication was abandoned in 1969 and attention instead focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and f",

    "content": "### Fungi\nMost phytopathogenic fungi are Ascomycetes or Basidiomycetes. They reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soil borne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living saprotrophically, carrying out the role of their life cycle in the soil. These are facultative saprotrophs. Fungal diseases may be controlled through the use of fungicides and other agricultural practices. However, new races of fungi often evolve that are resistant to various fungicides. Biotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells. Necrotrophic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells.[3] Significant fungal plant pathogens  include:\n\n### Fungus-Like Organisms\nThe oomycetes are fungus-like organisms among the Stramenopiles.[10] They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens, such as the causal agents of potato late blight[10] root rot,[11] and sudden oak death.[12][13] Despite not being closely related to the Fungi, the oomycetes have developed similar infection strategies, using effector proteins to turn off a plant's defenses.[14] Some slime molds in Phytomyxea cause important diseases, including clubroot in cabbage and its relatives and powdery scab in potatoes. These are caused by species of Plasmodiophora and Spongospora, respectively.[15]\n\n### Bacteria\nMost bacteria associated with plants are saprotrophic and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, cause disease, especially in subtropical and tropical regions of the world.[16][page needed] Most plant pathogenic bacteria are bacilli. Erwinia uses cell wall–degrading enzymes to cause soft rot. Agrobacterium changes the level of auxins to cause tumours with phytohormones. Bacterial plant pathogens include: Phytoplasma and Spiroplasma are obligate intracellular parasites, bacteria that lack cell walls and, like the mycoplasmas, which are human pathogens, they belong to the class Mollicutes. Their cells are extremely small, 1 to 2 micrometres across. They tend to have small genomes (roughly between 0.5 and 2 Mb). They are normally transmitted by leafhoppers (cicadellids) and psyllids, both sap-sucking insect vectors. These inject the bacteria into the plant's phloem, where it reproduces.[20]\n\n### Viruses\nMany plant viruses cause only a loss of crop yield. Therefore, it is not economically viable to try to control them, except when they infect perennial species, such as fruit trees.[citation needed] Most plant viruses have small, single-stranded RNA genomes. Some also have double stranded RNA or single or double stranded DNA. These may encode only three or four proteins: a replicase, a coat protein, a movement protein to facilitate cell to cell movement through plasmodesmata, and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector.[citation needed] Plant viruses are generally transmitted by a vector, but mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vectors are often insects such as aphids; others are fungi, nematodes, and protozoa. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the beet leafhopper that transmits the curly top virus causing disease in several crop plants.[21]\n\n### Nematodes\nSome nematodes parasitize plant roots. They are a problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Potato cyst nematodes (Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis) are widely distributed in Europe and the Americas, causing $300 million worth of damage in Europe annually. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction,[22] whereas cyst nematodes tend to be able to infect only a few species. Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.[23]\n\n### Protozoa\nA few plant diseases are caused by protozoa such as Phytomonas, a kinetoplastid.[24] They are transmitted as durable zoospores that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. Further, they can transmit plant viruses. When the motile zoospores come into contact with a root hair they produce a plasmodium which invades the roots.[citation needed]\n\n### Physiological Plant Disorders\nSome abiotic disorders can be confused with pathogen-induced disorders. Abiotic causes include natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires. [25]\n\n### Economic Impact\nPlant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnose plant health and metabolism.[26] As of 2018[update] the most costly diseases of the most produced crops worldwide are:[27]\n\n### Control Measures\nGiven the economic harm that plant disease can cause, countries may attempt to mitigate harms with border controls and other measures.[30]\n\n### Port And Border Inspection And Quarantine\nThe introduction of harmful non native organisms into a country can be reduced by controlling human traffic (e.g., the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service). Global trade provides unprecedented opportunities for the introduction of plant pests.[McC 1] In the United States, even to get a better estimate of the number of such introductions would require a substantial increase in inspections.[McC 2] In Australia a similar shortcoming of understanding has a different origin: Port inspections are not very useful because inspectors know too little about taxonomy. There are often pests that the Australian Government has prioritised as harmful to be kept out of the country, but which have near taxonomic relatives that confuse the issue.[BH 1] X-ray and electron-beam/E-beam irradiation of food has been trialed as a quarantine treatment for fruit commodities originating from Hawaii. The US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), USDA APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service), producers, and consumers were all accepting of the results - more thorough pest eradication and lesser taste degradation than heat treatment.[31] The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) anticipates that molecular diagnostics for inspections will continue to improve.[32] Between 2020 and 2030, IPPC expects continued technological improvement to lower costs and improve performance, albeit not for less developed countries unless funding changes.[32]\n\n### Chemical\nMany natural and synthetic compounds can be employed to combat plant diseases. This method works by directly eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however, it has been shown to have too broad an effect, typically, to be good for the local ecosystem. From an economic standpoint, all but the simplest natural additives may disqualify a product from \"organic\" status, potentially reducing the value of the yield.\n\n### Biological\nCrop rotation is a traditional and sometimes effective means of preventing pests and diseases from becoming well-established, alongside other benefits.[33] Other biological methods include inoculation. Protection against infection by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes gall diseases in many plants, can be provided by dipping cuttings in suspensions of Agrobacterium radio",

    "content": "### Concept\nA pest is any living thing which humans consider troublesome to themselves, their possessions, or the environment.[1] Pests can cause issues with crops, human or animal health, buildings, and wild areas or larger landscapes.[2] An older usage of the word \"pest\" is of a deadly epidemic disease, specifically plague. In its broadest sense, a pest is a competitor to humanity.[3] Pests include plants, pathogens, invertebrates, vertebrates, or any organism that harms an ecosystem.[2]\n\n### Animals\nAnimals are considered pests or vermin when they injure people or damage crops, forestry, or buildings. Elephants are regarded as pests by the farmers whose crops they raid and trample. Mosquitoes and ticks are vectors that can transmit ailments but are also pests because of the distress caused by their bites. Grasshoppers are usually solitary herbivores of little economic importance until the conditions are met for them to enter a swarming phase, become locusts and cause enormous damage.[4] Many people appreciate birds in the countryside and their gardens, but when these accumulate in large masses, they can be a nuisance. Flocks of starlings can consist of hundreds of thousands of individual birds, their roosts can be noisy and their droppings voluminous; the droppings are acidic and can cause corrosion of metals, stonework, and brickwork as well as being unsightly. Pigeons in urban settings may be a health hazard, and gulls near the coast can become a nuisance, especially if they become bold enough to snatch food from passers-by. All birds are a risk at airfields where they can be sucked into aircraft engines.[5] Woodpeckers sometimes excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, causing structural damage;[6] they also drum on various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, down-spouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting.[7] Jellyfish can form vast swarms which may be responsible for damage to fishing gear, and sometimes clog the cooling systems of power and desalination plants which draw their water from the sea.[8] Many of the animals that we regard as pests live in our homes. Before humans built dwellings, these creatures lived in the wider environment, but co-evolved with humans, adapting to the warm, sheltered conditions that a house provides, the wooden timbers, the furnishings, the food supplies and the rubbish dumps. Many no longer exist as free-living organisms in the outside world, and can therefore be considered to be domesticated.[9] The St Kilda house mouse rapidly became extinct when the last islander left the island of St Kilda, Scotland in 1930, but the St Kilda field mouse survived.[10]\n\n### Plants\nPlants may be considered pests, for example, if they are invasive species or weeds. There is no universal definition of what makes a plant a pest. Some governments, such as that of Western Australia, permit their authorities to prescribe as a pest plant \"any plant that, in the local government authority's opinion, is likely to adversely affect the environment of the district, the value of property in the district, or the health, comfort or convenience of the district's inhabitants.\"[12] An example of such a plant prescribed under this regulation is caltrop, Tribulus terrestris, which can cause poisoning in sheep and goats, but is mainly a nuisance around buildings, roadsides and recreation areas because of its uncomfortably sharp spiny burrs.[11]\n\n### Ecology\nThe term \"plant pest\", mainly applied to insect micropredators of plants, has a specific definition in terms of the International Plant Protection Convention and phytosanitary measures worldwide. A pest is any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal, or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products.[14] Worldwide, agricultural pest impacts are increased by higher degrees of interconnectedness. This is due to the increased risk that any particular pest problem anywhere in the world (as a system) will propagate across the entire system.[15]\n\n### Plant Defences Against Pests\nPlants have developed strategies that they use in their own defence, be they thorns (modified stems) or spines (modified leaves), stings, a thick cuticle or waxy deposits, with the second line of defence being toxic or distasteful secondary metabolites. Mechanical injury to the plant tissues allows the entry of pathogens and stimulates the plant to mobilise its chemical defences. The plant soon seals off the wound to reduce further damage.[16] Plants sometimes take active steps to reduce herbivory. Macaranga triloba for example has adapted its thin-walled stems to create ideal housing for an ant Crematogaster spp., which, in turn, protects the plant from herbivores. In addition to providing housing, the plant also provides the ant with its exclusive food source in the form of food bodies located on the leaf stipules.[17]  Similarly, several Acacia tree species have developed stout spines that are swollen at the base, forming a hollow structure that provides housing for ants which protect the plant. These Acacia trees also produce nectar in nectaries on their leaves as food for the ants.[18]\n\n### Climate Change\nPest ranges are heavily determined by climate. The most common example for the longest time has been rainfall: Although drought stress weakens crop disease resistance, drought also retards contagion and infection; and some variability in precipitation is universal. More recently climate change has been rapidly altering ranges, mostly by pushing them towards the poles (both North[19][20] and South).[21][22] From 1960–2013 ranges have shifted poleward by 2.7 ± 0.8 km (1.68 ± 0.50 mi) per year - albeit with significant differences between taxa. (Especially in the case of viruses and nematodes which show the opposite trend, toward the equator. This may be due to their lack of airborne dispersal, so their trend conforms with the trend of human-aided dispersal; or identification difficulties in the field.)[19] In Europe, crop pests are expected to burgeon as the vertebrate predators which control them are expected to be suppressed by future climatic conditions.[20][21]\n\n### In Agriculture And Horticulture\nTogether pests and diseases cause up to 40% yield losses every year.[23] The animal groups of the greatest importance as agricultural pests are (in order of economic importance) insects, mites, nematodes and gastropod molluscs.[24][25] Insects are responsible for two major forms of damage to crops. First, there is the direct injury they cause to the plants as they feed on the tissues; a reduction in leaf surface available for photosynthesis, distortion of growing shoots, a diminution of the plant's growth and vigour, and the wilting of shoots and branches caused by the insects' tunneling activities. Secondly there is the indirect damage, where the insects do little direct harm, but either transmit or allow entry of fungal, bacterial or viral infections.[26]  Although some insects are polyphagous, many are restricted to one specific crop, or group of crops. In many cases it is the larva that feeds on the plant, building up a nutritional store that will be used by the short-lived adult; sawfly and lepidopteran larvae feed mainly on the aerial portions of plants while beetle larvae tend to live underground, feeding on roots, or tunnel into the stem or under the bark. The true bugs, Hemiptera, have piercing and sucking mouthparts and live by sucking sap from plants. These include aphids, whiteflies and scale insects. Apart from weakening the plant, they encourage the growth of sooty mould on the honeydew the insects produce, which cuts out the light and reduces photosynthesis, stunting the plant's growth. They often transmit serious viral diseases between plants.[27] The mites that cause most trouble in the field are the spider mites. These are less than 1 mm (0.04 in) in diameter, can be very numerous, and thrive in hot, dry conditions. They mostly live on the underside of le",

    "content": "### History\nIt has long been assumed that weeds, in the sense of rapidly evolving plants taking advantage of human-disturbed environments, evolved in response to the Neolithic agricultural revolution approximately 12,000 years ago. However, researchers have found evidence of \"proto-weeds\" behaving in similar ways at Ohalo II, a 23,000-year-old archeological site in Israel.[13] The idea of \"weeds\" as a category of undesirable plant has not been universal throughout history. Before 1200 A.D., little evidence exists of concern with weed control or of agricultural practices solely intended to control weeds. A possible reason for this is that for much of human history, women and children were an abundant source of cheap labor to control weeds, and not directly acknowledged.[14] Weeds are assumed to have existed since the beginning of agriculture, and accepted as an \"inevitable nuisance.\"[15] Though the plants are not named using a specific term denoting a \"weed\" in the contemporary sense, plants that may be interpreted as \"weeds\" are referenced in the Bible:[8] Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground.[16] Some early Roman writers referenced weeding activities in agricultural fields, but weed control in the pre-modern era was probably an incidental effect of plowing.[17] Ancient Egyptians, Assyrians, and Sumerians had no specific word for \"weeds,\" seeing all plants as having some use. The English word \"weed\" can be traced back to the Old English weod, which refers to woad, rather than a category of plant as in the modern usage; in early medieval European herbals, each plant is regarded as having its own \"virtues\".[18] By the sixteenth century, the concept of a \"weed\" was better defined as a \"noxious\" or undesirable type of plant, as referenced metaphorically in William Shakespeare's works.[18] An example of a Shakespearean reference to weeds is found in Sonnet 69: To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: / But why thy odour matcheth not thy show, / The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.[19] In London during this period, poor women were paid low wages to weed gardens and courtyards.[20] After the Reformation, Christian theology that emphasized the degradation of nature after the Fall of Man, and humankind's role and duty to dominate and subdue nature, became more developed and widespread. Various European writers designated certain plants as \"vermin\" and \"filth,\" though many plants identified as such were valued by gardeners or by herbalists and apothecaries, and some questioned the idea that any plant could be without purpose or value.[18] Laws mandating the control of weeds emerged as early as the seventeenth century; in 1691 a law in New York required the removal of \"poysonous and Stincking Weeds\" in front of houses.[21] In the nineteenth century, manual labor was used to control weeds in European towns and cities, and chemical methods of weed control emerged. For example, a French journal in 1831 documented a mixture of sulfur, lime and water boiled in an iron cauldron as an effective herbicide to prevent grass from growing among cobblestones.[20] The cultural association between weeds and moral or spiritual degradation persisted into the last nineteenth century in American cities. Urban expansion and development created ideal habitats for weeds in nineteenth-century America.[21] Reformers consequently saw weeds as a part of the larger problem of filth, disease, and moral corruption that plagued the urban environments, and weeds were seen as refuge for \"tramps\" and other criminal or undesirable people. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch credited weeds as causing diphtheria, scarlet fever, and typhoid.[21] In St. Louis between the years of 1905-1910, weeds became viewed as a major public health hazard, believed to cause typhoid and malaria, and legal precedents were set in order to control weeds that would help facilitate the adoption of weed control laws throughout the country.[21]\n\n### Ecological Significance\n\"Weed\" as a category of plant overlaps with the closely related concepts of ruderal and pioneer species.[22] Pioneer species are specifically adapted to disturbed environments, where the existing plant and soil community has been disrupted or damaged in some way. Adaptation to disturbance can give weeds advantages over desirable crops, pastures, or ornamental plants. The nature of the habitat and its disturbances will affect or even determine which types of weed communities become dominant.[23] In weed ecology some authorities speak of the relationship between \"the three Ps\": plant, place, perception. These have been very variously defined, but the weed traits listed by H.G. Baker are widely cited.[24][25] Examples of such ruderal or pioneer species include plants that are adapted to naturally occurring disturbed environments such as dunes and other windswept areas with shifting soils, alluvial flood plains, river banks and deltas, and areas that are burned repeatedly.[26] Since human agricultural and horticultural practices often mimic these natural disturbances that weedy species have adapted for, some weeds are effectively preadapted to grow and proliferate in human-disturbed areas such as agricultural fields, lawns, gardens, roadsides, and construction sites. As agricultural practices continue and develop, weeds evolve further, with humans exerting evolutionary pressure upon weeds through manipulating their habitat and attempting to control weed populations.[10] Due to their ability to survive and thrive in conditions challenging or hostile to other plants, weeds have been considered extremophiles.[27]\n\n### Adaptability\nDue to their evolutionary heritage as disturbance-adapted pioneers, most weeds exhibit incredibly high phenotype plasticity, meaning that individual plants hold the potential to adapt their morphology, growth, and appearance in response to their conditions.[22] The potential within a single individual to adapt to a wide variety of conditions is sometimes referred to as an \"all-purpose genotype.\"[28] Disturbance-adapted plants typically grow rapidly and reproduce quickly, with some annual weeds having multiple generations in a single growing season. They commonly have seeds that persist in the soil seed bank for many years. Perennial weeds often have underground stems that spread under the soil surface or, like ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), have creeping stems that root and spread out over the ground.[29] These traits make many disturbance-adapted plants highly successful as weeds.[22] On top of the ability of individual plants to adapt to their conditions, weed populations also evolve much more quickly than older models of evolution account for.[28] Once established in an agricultural setting, weeds have been observed to undergo evolutionary changes to adapt to selective pressures imposed by human management. Some examples include changes in seed dormancy, changes in seasonal life cycles, changes in plant morphology, and the evolution of resistance to herbicides.[10] Rapid life cycles, large populations, and ability to spread large numbers of seeds long distances also allow weed species with these general characteristics to evolve quickly.[30]\n\n### Dispersal\nThe concept of weeds also overlaps with the concept of invasive species, both in the sense that human activities tend to introduce weeds outside their native range, and that an introduced species may be considered a weed. Many weed species have moved out of their natural geographic ranges and spread around the world in tandem with human migrations and commerce. Weed seeds are often collected and transported with crops after the harvesting of grains, so humans are a vector of transport as well as a producer of the disturbed environments",

Organisms that cause systemic mycoses are inherently virulent.[further explanation needed].[citation needed] Systemic mycoses due to opportunistic pathogens are infections of people with immune deficiencies who would otherwise not be infected. Examples of immunocompromised conditions include AIDS, alteration of normal flora by antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy, and metastatic cancer. Examples of opportunistic mycoses include Candidiasis, Cryptococcosis and Aspergillosis.[citation needed]\n\n### Signs And Symptoms\nMost common mild mycoses often present with a rash.[2] Infections within the skin or under the skin may present with a lump and skin changes.[3] Less common deeper fungal infections may present with pneumonia-like symptoms or meningitis.[2]\n\n### Causes\nMycoses are caused by certain fungi; yeasts, molds and some fungi that can exist as both a mold and yeast.[3][6] They are everywhere and infection occurs after spores are either breathed in, come into contact with skin or enter the body through the skin such as via a cut, wound or injection.[3] Candida albicans is the most common cause of fungal infection in people, particularly as oral or vaginal thrush, often following taking antibiotics.[3]\n\n### Risk Factors\nFungal infections are more likely in people with weak immune systems.[14] This includes people with illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, and people taking medicines such as steroids or cancer treatments.[14] People with diabetes also tend to develop fungal infections.[19] Very young and very old people, also, are groups at risk.[20] Individuals being treated with antibiotics are at higher risk of fungal infections.[21] Children whose immune systems are not functioning properly (such as children with cancer) are at risk of invasive fungal infections.[22]\n\n### Covid-19\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic some fungal infections have been associated with COVID-19.[10][23][24] Fungal infections can mimic COVID-19 and occur at the same time as COVID-19, and more serious fungal infections can complicate COVID-19.[10] A fungal infection may occur after antibiotics for a bacterial infection which has occurred following COVID-19.[25] The most common serious fungal infections in people with COVID-19 include aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis.[26] COVID-19–associated mucormycosis is generally less common, but in 2021 was noted to be significantly more prevalent in India.[10][27]\n\n### Mechanism\nFungal infections occur after spores are  breathed in, come into contact with skin or enter the body through a wound.[3]\n\n### Diagnosis\nDiagnosis is generally by signs and symptoms, microscopy, biopsy, culture and sometimes with the aid of medical imaging.[6]\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\nSome tinea and candidiasis infections of the skin can appear similar to eczema and lichen planus.[7] Pityriasis versicolor can look like seborrheic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, pityriasis alba and vitiligo.[7] Some fungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis can present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath, thereby resembling COVID-19.[28]\n\n### Prevention\nKeeping the skin clean and dry, as well as maintaining good hygiene, will help larger topical mycoses. Because some fungal infections are contagious, it is important to wash hands after touching other people or animals. Sports clothing should also be washed after use.[clarification needed][citation needed]\n\n### Treatment\nTreatment depends on the type of fungal infection, and usually requires topical or systemic antifungal medicines.[15] Pneumocystosis that does not respond to anti-fungals is treated with co-trimoxazole.[29] Sometimes, infected tissue needs to be surgically cut away.[3]\n\n### Epidemiology\nWorldwide, every year fungal infections affect more than one billion people.[11] An estimated 1.6 million deaths from fungal disease were reported in 2017.[30] The figure has been rising, with an estimated 1.7 million deaths from fungal disease reported in 2020.[12] Fungal infections also constitute a significant cause of illness and mortality in children.[31] According to the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections, every year there are over 10 million cases of fungal asthma, around 3 million cases of long-term aspergillosis of lungs, 1 million cases of blindness due to fungal keratitis, more than 200,000 cases of meningitis due to cryptococcus, 700,000 cases of invasive candidiasis, 500,000 cases of pneumocystosis of lungs, 250,000 cases of invasive aspergillosis, and 100,000 cases of histoplasmosis.[32]\n\n### History\nIn 500 BC, an account of ulcers in the mouth by Hippocrates may have described thrush.[33] Paris-based Hungarian microscopist David Gruby first reported that human disease could be caused by fungi in the early 1840s.[33]\n\n### Sars 2003\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak, fungal infections were reported in 14.8–33% of people affected by SARS, and it was the cause of death in 25–73.7% of people with SARS.[34]\n\n### Other Animals\nA wide range of fungal infections occur in other animals, and some can be transmitted from animals to people, such as Microsporum canis from cats.[17]",

    "content": "### Diseases\nEach species has specific effect and causes symptoms in people who are infected. Some people who are infected with a pathogenic bacteria do not have symptoms. Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible to pathogenic bacteria.[8]\n\n### Pathogenic Susceptibility\nSome pathogenic bacteria cause disease under certain conditions, such as entry through the skin via a cut, through sexual activity or through compromised immune function.[citation needed] Some species of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are part of the normal skin microbiota and typically reside on healthy skin or in the nasopharyngeal region. Yet these species can potentially initiate skin infections. Streptococcal infections include sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis.[9] These infections can become serious creating a systemic inflammatory response resulting in massive vasodilation, shock, and death.[10] Other bacteria are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people with immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis. Examples of these opportunistic pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium.[11][12]\n\n### Intracellular\nObligate intracellular parasites (e.g. Chlamydophila, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia) are only able to grow and replicate inside other cells. Infections due to obligate intracellular bacteria may be asymptomatic, requiring an incubation period. Examples of obligate intracellular bacteria include Rickettsia prowazekii (typhus) and Rickettsia rickettsii, (Rocky Mountain spotted fever).[citation needed] Chlamydia are intracellular parasites. These pathogens can cause pneumonia or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease.[13] Other groups of intracellular bacterial pathogens include Salmonella, Neisseria, Brucella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Listeria, Francisella, Legionella, and Yersinia pestis. These can exist intracellularly, but can exist outside host cells.[citation needed]\n\n### Infections In Specific Tissue\nBacterial pathogens often cause infection in specific areas of the body.  Others are generalists.\n\n### Mechanisms Of Damage\nThe symptoms of disease appear as pathogenic bacteria damage host tissues or interfere with their function. The bacteria can damage host cells directly or indirectly by provoking an immune response that inadvertently damages host cells,[22] or by releasing  toxins.[23]\n\n### Direct\nOnce pathogens attach to host cells, they can cause direct damage as the pathogens use the host cell for nutrients and produce waste products.[24] For example, Streptococcus mutans, a component of dental plaque, metabolizes dietary sugar and produces acid as a waste product.  The acid decalcifies the tooth surface to cause dental caries.[25] Endotoxins are the lipid portions of lipopolysaccharides that are part of the outer membrane of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins are released when the bacteria lyses, which is why after antibiotic treatment, symptoms can worsen at first as the bacteria are killed and they release their endotoxins. Exotoxins are secreted into the surrounding medium or released when the bacteria die and the cell wall breaks apart.[26]\n\n### Indirect\nAn excessive or inappropriate immune response triggered by an infection may damage host cells.[1]\n\n### Nutrients\nIron is required for humans, as well as the growth of most bacteria. To obtain free iron, some pathogens secrete proteins called siderophores, which take the iron away from iron-transport proteins by binding to the iron even more tightly. Once the iron-siderophore complex is formed, it is taken up by siderophore receptors on the bacterial surface and then that iron is brought into the bacterium.[26] Bacterial pathogens also require access to carbon and energy sources for growth. To avoid competition with host cells for glucose which is the main energy source used by human cells, many pathogens including the respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae specialise in using other carbon sources such as lactate that are abundant in the human body [27]\n\n### Identification\nTypically identification is done by growing the organism in a wide range of cultures which can take up to 48 hours. The growth is then visually or genomically identified. The cultured organism is then subjected to various assays to observe reactions to help further identify species and strain.[28]\n\n### Treatment\nBacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. For example, the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracyclin inhibit the bacterial ribosome but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome, so they exhibit selective toxicity.[29] Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth. Both uses may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations.[30] Phage therapy, using bacteriophages can also be used to treat certain bacterial infections.[31]\n\n### Prevention\nInfections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent infection by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection. Bacteria in food are killed by cooking to temperatures above 73 °C (163 °F).[citation needed]\n\n### List Of Genera And Microscopy Features\nMany genera contain pathogenic bacterial species. They often possess characteristics that help to classify and organize them into groups. The following is a partial listing.\n\n### List Of Species And Clinical Characteristics\nThis is description of the more common genera and species presented with their clinical characteristics and treatments.

The vast majority of these act on pectins (for example, pectinesterase, pectate lyase, and pectinases). For microbes, the cell wall polysaccharides are both a food source and a barrier to be overcome. Many pathogens grow opportunistically when the host breaks down its own cell walls, most often during fruit ripening.[3] Unlike human and animal pathology, plant pathology usually focuses on a single causal organism; however, some plant diseases have been shown to be interactions between multiple pathogens.[4] To colonize a plant, pathogens have specific pathogenicity factors, of five main types: uses of cell wall–degrading enzymes, toxins, effector proteins, phytohormones, and exopolysaccharides.\n\n### Physiological Plant Disorders\nSome abiotic disorders can be confused with pathogen-induced disorders. Abiotic causes include natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires.[10]\n\n### Epidemiology\nEpidemiology is the study of factors affecting the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.[11] A disease triangle describes the basic factors required for plant diseases. These are the host plant, the pathogen, and the environment. Any one of these can be modified to control a disease.[12]\n\n### Disease Resistance\nPlant disease resistance is the ability of a plant to prevent and terminate infections from plant pathogens. Structures that help plants prevent pathogens from entering are the cuticular layer, cell walls, and stomata guard cells. Once pathogens have overcome these barriers, plant receptors initiate signaling pathways to create molecules to compete against the foreign molecules. These pathways are influenced and triggered by genes within the host plant and can be manipulated by genetic breeding to create resistant varieties.[13]\n\n### Detection\nAncient methods of leaf examination and breaking open plant material by hand are now augmented by newer technologies. These include molecular pathology assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RT-PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).[14] Although PCR can detect multiple molecular targets in a single solution there are limits.[14] Bertolini et al. 2001, Ito et al. 2002, and Ragozzino et al. 2004 developed PCR methods for multiplexing six or seven plant pathogen molecular products and Persson et al. 2005 for multiplexing four with RT-PCR.[14] More extensive molecular diagnosis requires PCR arrays.[14] The primary detection method used worldwide is enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.[15]\n\n### Biological\nCrop rotation is a traditional and sometimes effective means of preventing a parasitic population from becoming well-established. For example, protection against infection by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes gall diseases in many plants, by dipping cuttings in suspensions of Agrobacterium radiobacter before inserting them in the ground to take root.[16]\n\n### History\nPlant pathology has developed from antiquity, starting with Theophrastus in the ancient era, but scientific study began in the Early Modern period with the invention of the microscope, and developed in the 19th century.[17]",

    "title": "Aphid",
    "content": "### Etymology\nThe name aphid is from Carl Linnaeus's modern Latin, most likely from misreading the Middle Greek κόρῐς, koris, 'bug' as αφῐς, aphis.[2]\n\n### Distribution\nAphids are distributed worldwide, but are most common in temperate zones. In contrast to many taxa, aphid species diversity is much lower in the tropics than in the temperate zones.[3] They can migrate great distances, mainly through passive dispersal by winds. Winged aphids may also rise up in the day as high as 600 m where they are transported by strong winds.[4][5] For example, the currant-lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribisnigri, is believed to have spread from New Zealand to Tasmania around 2004 through easterly winds.[6] Aphids have also been spread by human transportation of infested plant materials, making some species nearly cosmopolitan in their distribution.[7]\n\n### Fossil History\nAphids, and the closely related adelgids and phylloxerans, probably evolved from a common ancestor some 280 million years ago, in the Early Permian period.[9] They probably fed on plants like Cordaitales or Cycadophyta. With their soft bodies, aphids do not fossilize well, and the oldest known fossil is of the species Triassoaphis cubitus from the Triassic.[10] They do however sometimes get stuck in plant exudates which solidify into amber. In 1967, when Professor Ole Heie wrote his monograph Studies on Fossil Aphids, about sixty species had been described from the Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and mostly the Tertiary periods, with Baltic amber contributing another forty species.[11] The total number of species was small, but increased considerably with the appearance of the angiosperms 160 million years ago, as this allowed aphids to specialise, the speciation of aphids going hand-in-hand with the diversification of flowering plants. The earliest aphids were probably polyphagous, with monophagy developing later.[12] It has been hypothesized that the ancestors of the Adelgidae lived on conifers while those of the Aphididae fed on the sap of Podocarpaceae or Araucariaceae that survived extinctions in the late Cretaceous. Organs like the cornicles did not appear until the Cretaceous period.[9][13] One study alternatively suggests that ancestral aphids may have lived on angiosperm bark and that feeding on leaves may be a derived trait. The Lachninae have long mouth parts that are suitable for living on bark and it has been suggested that the mid-Cretaceous ancestor fed on the bark of angiosperm trees, switching to leaves of conifer hosts in the late Cretaceous.[14] The Phylloxeridae may well be the oldest family still extant, but their fossil record is limited to the Lower Miocene Palaeophylloxera.[15]\n\n### Taxonomy\nLate 20th-century reclassification within the Hemiptera reduced the old taxon \"Homoptera\" to two suborders: Sternorrhyncha (aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc.) and Auchenorrhyncha (cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc.) with the suborder Heteroptera containing a large group of insects known as the true bugs. The infraorder Aphidomorpha within the Sternorrhyncha varies with circumscription with several fossil groups being especially difficult to place but includes the Adelgoidea, the Aphidoidea and the Phylloxeroidea.[16] Some authors use a single superfamily Aphidoidea within which the Phylloxeridae and Adelgidae are also included while others have Aphidoidea with a sister superfamily Phylloxeroidea within which the Adelgidae and Phylloxeridae are placed.[17] Early 21st-century reclassifications substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., Eriosomatidae), and many old subfamilies were elevated to family rank. The most recent authoritative classifications have three superfamilies Adelgoidea, Phylloxeroidea and Aphidoidea. The Aphidoidea includes a single large family Aphididae that includes all the ~5000[3] extant species.[18]\n\n### Phylogeny\nAphids, adelgids, and phylloxerids are very closely related within the suborder Sternorrhyncha, the plant-sucking bugs. They are either placed in the insect superfamily Aphidoidea[19] or into the superfamily Phylloxeroidea which contains the family Adelgidae and the family Phylloxeridae.[12] Like aphids, phylloxera feed on the roots, leaves, and shoots of grape plants, but unlike aphids, do not produce honeydew or cornicle secretions.[20] Phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) are insects which caused the Great French Wine Blight that devastated European viticulture in the 19th century. Similarly, adelgids or woolly conifer aphids, also feed on plant phloem and are sometimes described as aphids, but are more properly classified as aphid-like insects, because they have no cauda or cornicles.[21] The treatment of the groups especially concerning fossil groups varies greatly due to difficulties in resolving relationships. Most modern treatments include the three superfamilies, the Adelogidea, the Aphidoidea, and the Phylloxeroidea within the infraorder Aphidomorpha along with several fossil groups.[22] Psylloidea (jumping plant lice, etc) Aleyrodoidea (whiteflies) Coccoidea (scale insects) Phylloxeridae (phylloxerans) Adelgidae (woolly conifer aphids) Aphididae (aphids) The phylogenetic tree, based on Papasotiropoulos 2013 and Kim 2011, with additions from Ortiz-Rivas and Martinez-Torres 2009, shows the internal phylogeny of the Aphididae.[23][24][25] It has been suggested that the phylogeny of the aphid groups might be revealed by examining the phylogeny of their bacterial endosymbionts, especially the obligate endosymbiont Buchnera. The results depend on the assumption that the symbionts are strictly transmitted vertically through the generations. This assumption is well supported by the evidence, and several phylogenetic relationships have been suggested on the basis of endosymbiont studies.[26][27][28] Lachninae Hormaphidinae Calaphidinae Chaitophorinae Eriosomatinae (woolly aphids) Anoeciinae Capitophorus, Pterocomma Macrosiphini Rhopalosiphina Aphidina (Aphis spp)\n\n### Anatomy\nMost aphids have soft bodies, which may be green, black, brown, pink, or almost colorless. Aphids have antennae with two short, broad basal segments and up to four slender terminal segments. They have a pair of compound eyes, with an ocular tubercle behind and above each eye, made up of three lenses called triommatidia.[12] They feed on sap and plant fluids using piercing-sucking mouthparts called stylets, enclosed in a sheath called a rostrum, which is formed from modifications of the mandible and maxilla of the insect mouthparts.[29] They have long, thin legs with two-jointed, two-clawed tarsi. The majority of aphids are wingless, but winged forms are produced at certain times of year in many species. Most aphids have a pair of cornicles (siphunculi), abdominal tubes on the dorsal surface of their fifth abdominal segment, through which they exude droplets of a quick-hardening defensive fluid[29] containing triacylglycerols, called cornicle wax. Other defensive compounds can also be produced by some species.[21] Aphids have a tail-like protrusion called a cauda above their rectal apertures.[12][30] They have lost their Malpighian tubules.[31] When host plant quality becomes poor or conditions become crowded, some aphid species produce winged offspring (alates) that can disperse to other food sources. The mouthparts or eyes can be small or missing in some species and forms.[21]\n\n### Diet\nMany aphid species are monophagous (that is, they feed on only one plant species). Others, like the green peach aphid, feed on hundreds of plant species across many families. About 10% of species feed on different plants at different times of the year.[32] A new host plant is chosen by a winged adult by using visual cues, followed by olfaction using the antennae; if the plant smells right, the next action is probing the surface upon landing. The stylus is inserted and saliva secreted, the sap is sampled, ",

    "content": "### Swarming Grasshoppers\nLocusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.[2][3][4] No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. In English, the term \"locust\" is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding, forming swarms that develop from bands of immature stages called hoppers. The change is described as density-dependent phenotypic plasticity.[5] These changes are examples of phase polyphenism; they were first analysed and described by Boris Uvarov, who was instrumental in setting up the Anti-Locust Research Centre.[6] He made his discoveries during his studies of the migratory locust in the Caucasus, whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species (Locusta migratoria and L. danica L.). He designated the two phases as solitaria and gregaria.[7] These are called statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory. Charles Valentine Riley and Norman Criddle were involved in achieving the understanding and control of locusts.[8][9] Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin.[10] This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period.[11] A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million per square kilometre (200 million per square mile).[12] When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.[13][14][15] The formation of initial bands of gregarious hoppers is called an \"outbreak\"; when these join into larger groups, the event is known as an \"upsurge\". Continuing agglomerations of upsurges on a regional level originating from a number of entirely separate breeding locations are known as \"plagues\".[16] During outbreaks and the early stages of upsurges, only part of the locust population becomes gregarious, with scattered bands of hoppers spread out over a large area. As time goes by, the insects become more cohesive and the bands become concentrated in a smaller area. In the desert locust plague in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia that lasted from 1966 to 1969, the number of locusts increased from two to 30 billion over two generations, but the area covered decreased from over 100,000 square kilometres (39,000 sq mi) to 5,000 square kilometres (1,900 sq mi).[17]\n\n### Solitary And Gregarious Phases\nOne of the greatest differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen as early as the second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way around barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects involves visual and olfactory cues.[18] The bands seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before continuing on, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.[7] Locusts in the gregarious phase differ in morphology and development. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have a longer nymphal period; the adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates; they mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have lower levels of fecundity.[7] The mutual attraction between individual insects continues into adulthood, and they continue to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals at the front of the swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.[7]\n\n### Distribution And Diversity\nSeveral species of grasshoppers swarm as locusts in different parts of the world, on all continents except Antarctica:[19][20][21][a] For example, the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera) swarms across Australia.[19] The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is probably the best known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent)[19] and its ability to migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa from 2003 to 2005, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands.[23][24] Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years.[25][26] The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.[27] The migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), sometimes classified into up to 10 subspecies, swarms in Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, but has become rare in Europe.[28] In 2013, the Madagascan form of the migratory locust formed many swarms of over a billion insects, reaching \"plague\" status and covering about half the country by March 2013.[29] \nSpecies such as the Senegalese grasshopper (Oedaleus senegalensis)[30] and the African rice grasshopper (Hieroglyphus daganensis), both from the Sahel, often display locust-like behaviour and change morphologically on crowding.[30] North America is the only sub-continent besides Antarctica without a native locust species. The Rocky Mountain locust was formerly one of the most significant insect pests there, but it became extinct in 1902.[31] In the 1930s, during the Dust Bowl, a second species of North American locust, the High Plains locust (Dissosteira longipennis), reached plague proportions in the American Midwest. Today, the High Plains locust is a rare species, leaving North America with no regularly swarming locusts.[32][33]\n\n### Evolution\nThe fossilized wing of an indeterminate locust has been found in Early Oligocene-aged sediments of the Pabdeh Formation in Iran, which were deposited in a deep marine environment. The locust was likely migrating across the early Paratethys Sea, between the emergent Arabian Peninsula and central Iran, which were still separated by large areas of deep ocean at this time. This suggests that trans-oceanic locust migrations have been occurring for at least 30 million years, likely facilitated by the spread of grasslands at the time.[34]\n\n### Ancient Times\nStudy of literature shows how pervasive plagues of locusts were over the course of history. The insects arrived unexpectedly, often after a change of wind direction or weather, and the consequences were devastating. The Ancient Egyptians carved locusts on tombs in the period 2470 to 2220 BC. A devastating plague in Egypt is mentioned in the Book of Exodus in the Bible.[17][35] Locust plague is mentioned in the Indian Mahabharata.[3",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word nematode comes from the Modern Latin compound of nema- 'thread' (from Greek nema, genitive nematos 'thread', from the stem nein 'to spin'; cf. needle) + -odes 'like, of the nature of' (cf. -oid). The addition firstly of '-oid' and then to '-ode' renders 'threadlike'.[20]\n\n### History\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus described nematodes of a few genera including Ascaris and Dracunculus, then included in the Vermes.[21] The name of the group Nematoda, informally called \"nematodes\", came from Nematoidea, originally defined by Karl Rudolphi in 1808,[22] from Ancient Greek νῆμα (nêma, nêmatos, 'thread') and -ειδής (-eidēs, 'species') (cf. native German Fadenwurm < Faden (yarn, thread) + Wurm, attested since the mid of 18th). It was treated as family Nematodes by Burmeister in 1837.[22] At its origin, the \"Nematoidea\" erroneously included Nematodes and Nematomorpha, attributed by Karl Theodor Ernst von Siebold in 1843. Along with Acanthocephala, Trematoda, and Cestoidea, it formed the obsolete group Entozoa,[23] created by Rudolphi in 1808.[24] They were classed along with Acanthocephala in the obsolete phylum Nemathelminthes by Gegenbaur in 1859.[22] In 1861, Karl Moriz Diesing treated the group as order Nematoda.[22] In 1877, the taxon Nematoidea, including the family Gordiidae (horsehair worms), was promoted to the rank of phylum by Ray Lankester.[22] The first clear distinction between the nemas and gordiids was realized by František Vejdovsky when he named the group containing the horsehair worms the order Nematomorpha in 1886.[25] In 1910, Grobben proposed the phylum Aschelminthes, and the nematodes were included as class Nematoda alongside the classes Rotifera, Gastrotricha, Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Nematomorpha.[26]In 1919, Nathan Cobb proposed that nematodes should be recognized alone as a phylum. He argued they should be called \"nema\" in English rather than \"nematodes\" and defined the taxon Nemates (later emended as Nemata, Latin plural of nema), listing Nematoidea sensu restricto as a synonym.[27] In 1932, Potts elevated the class Nematoda to the level of phylum, leaving the name the same. Although Potts' and Cobb's classifications are equivalent, both names are used, and Nematode became a popular term in zoological science.[28]\n\n### Phylogeny\nThe phylogenetic relationships of the nematodes and their close relatives among the protostomes are unresolved. Traditionally, they were held to be a lineage of their own, but in the 1990s, they were proposed to form the group Ecdysozoa together with moulting animals, such as arthropods. The identity of the closest living relatives of the Nematoda has always been considered to be well resolved. Morphological and molecular phylogenetics agree with placing the roundworms as a sister taxon to the parasitic Nematomorpha; together, they make up the Nematoida. Along with the Scalidophora (formerly Cephalorhyncha), the Nematoida form the clade Cycloneuralia, but much disagreement occurs both between and among the available morphological and molecular data. The Cycloneuralia or the Introverta—depending on the validity of the former—are often ranked as a superphylum.[29][30]\n\n### Systematics\nDue to the lack of knowledge regarding many nematodes, their systematics is contentious. An early and influential classification was proposed by Chitwood and Chitwood[31]—later revised by Chitwood[32]—who divided the phylum into two classes—Aphasmidia and Phasmidia. These were later renamed Adenophorea (gland bearers) and Secernentea (secretors), respectively.[33] The Secernentea share several characteristics, including the presence of phasmids, a pair of sensory organs located in the lateral posterior region, and this was used as the basis for this division. This scheme was adhered to in many later classifications, though the Adenophorea were not in a uniform group. Initial studies of incomplete DNA sequences[34] suggested the existence of five clades:[35] The Secernentea seem to be a natural group of close relatives, while the Adenophorea appear to be a paraphyletic assemblage of roundworms that retain a good number of ancestral traits. The old Enoplia do not seem to be monophyletic, either, but do contain two distinct lineages. The old group Chromadorea seems to be another paraphyletic assemblage, with the Monhysterida representing a very ancient minor group of nematodes. Among the Secernentea, the Diplogasteria may need to be united with the Rhabditia, while the Tylenchia might be paraphyletic with the Rhabditia.[36] The understanding of roundworm systematics and phylogeny as of 2002 is summarised below: Phylum Nematoda Later work has suggested the presence of 12 clades.[37] In 2019, a study identified one conserved signature indel (CSI) found exclusively in members of the phylum Nematoda through comparative genetic analyses.[38] The CSI consists of a single amino acid insertion within a conserved region of a Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory factor protein NRFL-1 and is a molecular marker that distinguishes the phylum from other species.[38] An analysis of the mitochondrial DNA suggests that the following groupings are valid[39] In 2022 a new classification of the entire phylum Nematoda was presented by M. Hodda. It was based on current molecular, developmental and morphological evidence.[40] Under this classification, the classes and subclasses are:\n\n### Fossil Record\nNematode eggs from the clades Ascaridina, Spirurina, and Trichocephalida have been discovered in coprolites from the Oligocene-aged Tremembé Formation, which represented a palaeolake in present-day São Paulo with a diverse fossil assemblage of birds, fish, and arthropods that lent itself to fostering high nematode diversity.[41] Nematodes have also been found in various lagerstätten, such as Burmese amber, the Moltrasio Formation, and the Rhynie chert, where the earliest known fossils are known from.\n\n### Anatomy\nNematodes are very small, slender worms. Most are free-living, often less than 2.5 mm long and some only about 1 mm. Many nematodes are microscopic. Some soil nematodes can reach up to 7 mm in length, and some marine species can reach up to 5 cm. Some are parasitic and can reach lengths of 50 cm or more.[42] The body is often ornamented with ridges, rings, bristles, or other distinctive structures.[43] The head is relatively distinct. Whereas the rest of the body is bilaterally symmetrical, the head is radially symmetrical, with sensory bristles and, in many cases, solid 'head-shields' radiating outwards around the mouth. The mouth has either three or six lips, which often bear a series of teeth on their inner edges. An adhesive 'caudal gland' is often found at the tip of the tail.[44] The epidermis is either a syncytium or a single layer of cells, and is covered by a thick collagenous cuticle. The cuticle is often of a complex structure and may have two or three distinct layers. Underneath the epidermis lies a layer of longitudinal muscle cells. The relatively rigid cuticle works with the muscles to create a hydroskeleton, as nematodes lack circumferential muscles. Projections run from the inner surface of muscle cells towards the nerve cords; this is a unique arrangement in the animal kingdom, in which nerve cells normally extend fibers into the muscles rather than vice versa.[44]\n\n### Digestive System\nThe oral cavity is lined with cuticles, which are often strengthened with structures, such as ridges, especially in carnivorous species, which may bear several teeth. The mouth often includes a sharp stylet, which the animal can thrust into its prey. In some species, the stylet is hollow and can be used to suck liquids from plants or animals.[44] The oral cavity opens into a muscular, sucking pharynx, also lined with cuticle. Digestive glands are found in this region of the gut, producing enzymes that start to break down the food. In stylet-bearing species, these may even be injected into the prey.[44] No stomach is present, with the",

    "content": "### Description And Taxonomy\nThe Aleyrodidae are a family in the suborder Sternorrhyncha and at present comprise the entire superfamily Aleyrodoidea, related to the superfamily Psylloidea. The family often occurs in older literature as \"Aleurodidae\",[2] but that is a junior synonym and accordingly incorrect in terms of the international standards for zoological nomenclature.[3] Aleyrodidae are small insects, most species with a wingspan of less than 3 mm and a body length of 1 mm to 2 mm. Many are so small that their size complicates their control in greenhouses because they can only be excluded by screening with very fine mesh; in fact they can enter mesh so fine that many of their natural enemies cannot come in after them, so that unchecked whitefly populations in greenhouses rapidly become overwhelming. Some \"giant whitefly\" species exist, some of which may exceed 5 mm in size. This sometimes is associated with sexual dimorphism in which one sex is markedly larger than the other. Such dimorphism is common in the Sternorrhyncha, in which the males of most scale insects for example are tiny compared to the female. Remarkably however, in some giant tropical species the males are much larger than the females.[4] Like most of the mobile Sternorrhyncha, adult Aleyrodidae have well-developed antennae, which in most species in this family are seven-segmented.[5] As in many Hemiptera, there are two ocelli, which generally in the Aleyrodidae are placed at the anterior margins of the compound eyes. The compound eyes themselves are rather remarkable: many have a distinct constriction between the upper and lower halves, and in some species there is a complete separation.[5] Many insects' compound eyes are divided into functionally and anatomically distinct upper and lower regions, but the adaptation's purpose or origin in Aleyrodidae is unclear. The degree of separation is useful in recognising the species;[6] for instance, one way to tell adult Bemisia from Trialeurodes is that the upper and lower parts of the compound eyes are connected by a single ommatidium in Bemisia, while in Trialeurodes they are completely separate.[7] Both sexes have functional mouthparts and two pairs of membranous, functional wings; the rear wings are neither much reduced, nor modified into any such hooked or haltere-like structures as occur in some other Hemiptera such as many of the Coccoidea. The wing venation is reduced, like that of the Psyllidae, only generally much more so. In many genera there is only one conspicuous and unbranched vein in each wing; however, wings of larger species such as Udamoselis have less reduced venation, though their veins still are simple and few.[4] The insects and their wings are variously marked or mottled according to species, and many species are covered with fine wax powder, giving most species a floury, dusted appearance, hence names such as Aleyrodidae, Aleurodidae and Aleuroduplidens; the root refers to the Ancient Greek: αλευρώδης (aleurodes) meaning \"floury\".[8] However, not all species are white; for example, Aleurocanthus woglumi is slaty black. The legs of Aleyrodidae are well developed and fairly long, but gracile, and in contrast to Psyllidae, not adapted to leaping. The tarsi have two segments of roughly equal length. The pretarsus has paired claws, with an empodium between—in some species the empodium is a bristle, but in others it is a pad. The digestive system of the Aleyrodidae is typical of the Sternorrhyncha, including a filter chamber, and all active stages of the Aleyrodidae accordingly produce large quantities of honeydew; the anus is adapted to presentation of honeydew to symbiotic species, mainly ants; the honeydew emerges from the anus, which is inside an opening called the vasiform orifice on the dorsal surface of the caudal segment of the abdomen. This orifice is large and is covered by an operculum. The entire structure is characteristic of the Aleyrodidae and within the family it is taxonomically diagnostic because it varies in shape according to the species. Within the orifice beneath the operculum there is a tongue-like lingula. It appears to be involved in the expulsion of honeydew, and in fact at one time was wrongly assumed to be the organ that produced the honeydew. In some species it protrudes from beneath the operculum, but in others it normally is hidden.[2]\n\n### Evolutionary History\nThe oldest members of the family belong to the Mesozoic subfamily Bernaeinae, known from the Middle/Upper Jurassic-Upper Cretaceous, the oldest representatives of the extant subfamilies Aleyrodinae and Aleurodicinae appear during the Lower Cretaceous.[9]\n\n### Reproduction And Metamorphosis\nThe eggs of Aleyrodidae generally are laid near each other on the food plant, usually on a leaf, in spiral patterns or arcs, sometimes in parallel arcs. The egg is elongated, with one narrow end produced into a pedicel, which in some species is longer than the rest of the egg. After fertilisation the pedicel shrivels into a stalk.[2] The details vary, but at least some species can reproduce parthenogenically by automixis. However, apparently all males are parthenogenically produced by arrhenotoky. The female however, can mate with her own male offspring, and thereafter produce eggs of both sexes.[10] There generally are four larval instars. All the instars are more or less in the shape of a flattened ellipse fringed with bristles and waxy filaments. The first instar has functional legs, though short. Once it has inserted its stylets into the phloem to feed, it settles down and no longer uses its legs, and they degenerate after the first ecdysis. From then until it emerges as an adult, it remains attached to the plant by its mouthparts. The final instar feeds for a while, then undergoes changes within its skin, ceasing feeding and growing a new skin, forming what amounts to pupa. In doing so the insect does not shed the larval skin, which it retains as a protective puparium and which dries out. Meanwhile, the pupa within this skin develops into a pharate adult that usually is visible through the wall of the puparium. The puparium splits open as the imago forces its way out.[2][5] This pupal stage is analogous to the pupal forms of the Holometabola and it raises questions of terminology and concept. Some authorities argue that there is little functional, and no logically cogent basis for the distinction between the terms \"larva\" and \"nymph\". Some have long been in favour of dropping the term nymph entirely, and certainly apply the term \"larvae\" to the Aleyrodidae.[2][5]\n\n### Agricultural Threat\nIn warm or tropical climates and especially in greenhouses, whiteflies present major problems in crop protection. Worldwide economic losses are estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars annually.[11] Prominent pest species include: Although several species of whitefly may cause some crop losses simply by sucking sap when they are very numerous, the major harm they do is indirect. Firstly, like many other sap-sucking Hemiptera, they secrete large amounts of honeydew that support unsightly or harmful infestations of sooty mold. Recent studies suggest that insecticides can also be excreted through the honeydew leading to unintended effects.[12][13][14] Secondly, they inject saliva that may harm the plant more than either the mechanical damage of feeding or the growth of the fungi. However, by far their major importance as crop pests is their transmission of diseases of plants.[15] Although there are a great many species of whiteflies, and the family is notorious for devastating transmission of crop viruses, the actual proportion of whiteflies which are responsible is very low.[15] The most prominent disease vectors among the Aleyrodidae are a species complex in the genus Bemisia. Bemisia tabaci and B. argentifolii transmit African cassava mosaic, bean golden mosaic, bean dwarf mosaic, bean calico mosaic, tomato yellow leaf curl, tomato mottle, and other",

    "content": "### Impacts\nRusts are among the most harmful pathogens to agriculture, horticulture and forestry. Rust fungi are major concerns and limiting factors for successful cultivation of agricultural and forest crops.[citation needed] White pine blister rust, wheat stem rust, soybean rust, and coffee rust are examples of notoriously damaging threats to economically important crops.[3] Climate change may increase the prevalence of some rust species while causing others to decline through increased CO2 and O3, changes to temperature and humidity, and enhanced spore dispersal due to more frequent extreme weather events.[6]\n\n### Life Cycle\nAll rusts are obligate or biotrophic parasites, meaning that they require a living host to complete their life cycle. They generally do not kill the host plant but can severely reduce growth and yield.[7] Cereal crops can be devastated in one season; oak trees infected in the main stem within their first five years by the rust Cronartium quercuum often die.[8] Rust fungi can produce up to five spore types from corresponding fruiting body types during their life cycle, depending on the species. Roman numerals have traditionally been used to refer to these morphological types. Rust fungi are often categorized by their life cycle. Three basic types of life cycles are recognized based on the number of spore types as macrocyclic, demicyclic, and microcyclic.[3] The macrocyclic life cycle has all spore states, the demicyclic lacks the uredinial state, and the microcyclic cycle lacks the basidial, pycnial, and the aecial states, thus possess only uredinia and telia.  Spermagonia may be absent from each type but especially the microcyclic life cycle.  In macrocyclic and demicyclic life cycles, the rust may be either host alternating (heteroecious) (i.e., the aecial stage is on one kind of plant but the telial stage on a different and unrelated plant), or single-host (autoecious) (i.e., the aecial and telial states on the same plant host).[3] Heteroecious rust fungi require two unrelated hosts to complete their life cycle, with the primary host being infected by aeciospores and the alternate host being infected by basidiospores. This can be contrasted with an autoecious fungus, such as Puccinia porri, which can complete all parts of its life cycle on a single host species.[9] Understanding the life cycles of rust fungi allows for proper disease management.[11]\n\n### Host Plant–Rust Fungus Relationship\nThere are definite patterns of relationship with host plant groups and the rust fungi that parasitize them. Some genera of rust fungi, especially Puccinia and Uromyces, comprise species that are capable of parasitizing plants of many families.[citation needed] Other rust genera appear to be restricted to certain plant groups.[citation needed] Host restriction may, in heteroecious species, apply to both phases of life cycle or to only one phase.[3] As with many pathogen/host pairs, rusts are often in gene-for-gene relationships with their plants. This rust-plant gene-for-gene interaction differs somewhat from other gene-for-gene situations and has its own quirks and agronomic significance. Rust fungi decrease photosynthesis and elicit the emissions of different stress volatiles with increasing severity of infection.[12]\n\n### Infection Process\nThe spores of rust fungi may be dispersed by wind, water or insect vectors.[13] When a spore encounters a susceptible plant, it can germinate and infect plant tissues. A rust spore typically germinates on a plant surface, growing a short hypha called a germ tube. This germ tube may locate a stoma by a touch responsive process known as thigmotropism. This involves orienting to ridges created by epidermal cells on the leaf surface, and growing directionally until it encounters a stoma.[14] Over the stoma, a hyphal tip produces an infection structure called an appressorium. From the underside of an appressorium, a slender hypha grows downward to infect plant cells.[15] It is thought that the whole process is mediated by stretch-sensitive calcium ion channels located in the tip of the hypha, which produce electric currents and alter gene expression, inducing appressorium formation.[16] Once the fungus has invaded the plant, it grows into plant mesophyll cells, producing specialized hyphae known as haustoria. The haustoria penetrate cell walls but not cell membranes: plant cell membranes invaginate around the main haustorial body forming a space known as the extra-haustorial matrix. An iron- and phosphorus-rich neck band bridges the plant and fungal membranes in the space between the cells for water flow, known as the apoplast, thus preventing the nutrients reaching the plant's cells. The haustorium contains amino acid- and hexose sugar- transporters and H+-ATPases which are used for active transport of nutrients from the plant, nourishing the fungus.[17] The fungus continues growing, penetrating more and more plant cells, until spore growth occurs. The process repeats every 10–14 days, producing numerous spores that can be spread to other parts of the same plant, or to new hosts.\n\n### Common Rust Fungi In Agriculture\n[9][11][18]\n\n### Research\nEfforts to control rusts began to be scientifically based in the 20th century.[21] Elvin C. Stakman initiated the scientific study of host resistance, which had heretofore been poorly understood and handled by individual growers as part of the breeding process.[21] Stakman was followed by H. H. Flor's extensive discoveries of rust genetics.[21] In order to study rust metabolics, Tervet et al., 1951 developed the Cyclone Separator.[21] The cyclone separator uses the cyclonic separation mechanism to allow the mechanised collection of spores for study – Cherry & Peet 1966's improved version gathers even more efficiently.[21] This device was first put to work testing the composition of the spores themselves, especially substances coating the outside of the spores which signal population density.[21] When detected they help prevent crowding.[21] Gene cloning and other methods of genetic engineering can provide a much wider range of R genes and other sources of rust resistance – with reduced delay before deployment – if regulation of genetic engineering permits.[22]\n\n### Control\nThe control methods of rust fungus diseases depend largely on the life cycle of the particular pathogen. The following are examples of disease management plans used to control macrocyclic and demicyclic diseases: Macrocyclic disease: Developing a management plan for this type of disease depends largely on whether the urediniospores (rarely termed the \"repeating stage\") occur on the economically important host plant or the alternate host.[citation needed] For example, the repeating stage in white pine blister rust disease does not occur on white pines but on the alternate host, Ribes spp. During August and September Ribes spp. give rise to teliospores which infect white pines. Removal of the alternate host disrupts the life cycle of the rust fungi Cronartium ribicola, preventing the formation of basidiospores which infect the primary host. Although spores from white pines cannot infect other white pines, survival spores may overwinter on infected pines and reinfect Ribes spp. the following season. Infected tissue is removed from white pines and strict quarantines of Ribes spp. are maintained in high risk areas.[citation needed] Puccinia graminis is a macrocyclic heteroecious fungus that causes wheat stem rust disease.[citation needed] The sexual stage in this fungus occurs on the alternate host – barberry – and not wheat. The durable spore type produced on the alternate host allows the disease to persist in wheat even in more inhospitable environments. Planting resistant crops will prevent disease, however, virulence mutations will give rise to new strains of fungi that overcome plant resistance.[citation needed] Although the disease cannot be stopped by removal of the alternate host, the life cycl",

    "content": "### Description\nPowdery mildews exist in two states, the asexual anamorph state reproducing by means of conidia, and the sexual teleomorph state reproducing by means of ascospores produced in asci developing in more or less spherical chasmothecia. The ripe spores become detached and are readily dispersed by the wind, causing fresh infection. The usually conspicuous whitish mycelium and conidiophores on leaves, and sometimes on stems, fruits or even petals, are what is generally seen first. The chasmothecia are usually visible to the naked eye and turn from translucent or yellow-orange to purple or black. They are produced on the mycelium later in the season, though may be absent. Upon reaching maturity the chasmothecia may develop hair‐like appendages that may branch in characteristic ways.[3] The mycelium can appear in varying degrees of thickness and patchiness, on leaves, petioles, stems, twigs, fruits or flowers. On leaves, mycelium can be epiphyllous (on leaf uppersides), hypophyllous (on leaf undersides) or amphigenous (on both sides). Phyllactinia in particular is characterised by hypophyllous mycelium, although members of other genera also infect only the leaf undersides. Erysiphaceae species are occasionally also associated with galls. For example, Podosphaera phytoptophila is one of the causers of witch's broom galls on hackberry (Celtis occidentalis). Although not fully understood, it is believed that a minute, wormlike, eriophyid mite (Aceria celtis) induces the brooms and P. phytoptophila exploits the weakened plant and favourable habitat created by deformed buds and dense branching.[4] Cystotheca lanestris is also known as a North American gall-former, on various Quercus species.[5] The similarly-named but unrelated downy mildews (Peronosporaceae) can have a similar appearance to powdery mildews, however growth is always on the underside of leaves, often causing yellowing on the upperside. The mycelium of these members of the Peronosporales is internal in the plant tissue and the sporangiophores (more or less equivalent to conidiophores) emerge through the stomata; in the Peronosporaceae the sporangiophores are elongated and branched above so that the colonies are downy or felt‐like and usually greyish in colour.[3]\n\n### Ecology\nErysiphaceae species are obligate biotrophs, meaning they infect living plants. Specialised haustoria are able to penetrate the plant cells while keeping them alive. Most powdery mildew species are highly host-specific, infecting at most a few genera and frequently just a single species. The few species that are still rather broadly defined are considered species complexes with a narrow sensu stricto host range. Despite this, they are capable of 'jumping' host to infect a new genus. It is thought the now-common species in Europe Erysiphe alphitoides did this to first infect oaks (Quercus), facilitating its spread to the continent. Since then, it has also been reported as occurring on plants such as Wisteria, demonstrating the host-jumping ability that has lead to its success.[6][7] Some Erysiphaceae species host the hyperparasite Ampelomyces quisqualis.[8] This fungus reduces growth and may even kill the mildew, leading to its use as an active ingredient in some fungicides. Around 40 other fungal species have been known to parasitise powdery mildews: mainly ascomycetes such as Cladosporium but including basidiomycetes such as Tilletiopsis.[9]\n\n### Distribution\nErysiphaceae have a cosmopolitan distribution and are native to every continent other than Antarctica and Australia.[10] The centre of biodiversity appears to be in East Asia,[11] and many species have been introduced from here to other continents such as Europe and North America, often due to trade in plants for gardens. Some powdery mildew species can become invasive when introduced outside their native range.[12] As well as a circumglobal distribution, powdery mildews are also found in any and all habitats with enough vascular plants to sustain a population. While the diversity of powdery mildews in some areas (such as Western Europe) has been well-studied, there are undescribed species in all regions of the world, with the diversity of some areas such as much of Africa still little-known.\n\n### Identification\nWhile the benchmark for fungal identification remains the two-step combination of microscopy and DNA sequencing, a great many powdery mildew species can be identified in the field with a combination of host plant information and visible characteristics such as colour and texture. Due to the fact that all powdery mildew species are to some extent host-specific (most are highly restricted to only a single genus or even species) host plant identification is vital for identification in the field or often under the microscope. Some powdery mildew species even have identical ITS sequences,[13] meaning host plant information is still necessary even when the specimen is sequenced. Distinguishing characteristics in the field or from photos include the location of the infection on the plant, including what side of the leaf it infects; the thickness and colour of the mycelium; and sometimes the appearance and colour of chasmothecia if present. Under the microscope, a key characteristic to determine between genera is the presence or absence of fibrosin bodies in the conidia. Other characteristics useful for identification are the shape and length of conidia, whether they are single or on conidiophores, the shape of appresoria, and the appearance of chasmothecial appendages.[3]\n\n### Management\nSome cultivars of both vegetables and ornamental plants are bred to be resistant to powdery mildews. Powdery mildew thrives particularly in areas with little air flow, dry host leaves and humid conditions.[14] As a result, it is important to manage the environment around susceptible plants by: avoiding sheltered places, such as against walls or fences, where the air is likely to be still; providing good drainage, but watering regularly during dry periods (plants suffering from regular but intermittent drought-stress are more susceptible); not planting too densely, giving space between plants; and pruning shrubs to give an open structure improving air circulation and humidity. Application of mulch may help water retention. It is also recommended not to over-fertilise (especially not too much nitrogen) as succulent growth is particularly susceptible to infection.[15] Especially on an industrial scale, powdery mildew infections can be managed by the application of fungicides.[16] Spray programs of conventional fungicides are advised to begin when powdery mildew symptoms and signs are first noticed. Conventional fungicides should be applied on a regular basis for best results against the disease, although in some species there is a high risk of fungicide resistance.[17] Another effective prevention method is through genetic resistance. For example, combinations of variations of the Pm3 allele has been shown to provide improved protection against powdery mildew infection.[18] Several unconventional methods of chemical control have been tested to varying degrees of success. Some commonly reported methods include milk, sulphur, potassium bicarbonate, metal salts and oils.[19][20] Neem oil is said to effectively manage powdery mildew on many plants by interfering with the fungus' metabolism and terminating spore production. Milk has been proven effective at treating powdery mildew on some greenhouse crops,[21] potentially because ferroglobulin, a protein in whey, produces oxygen radicals when exposed to sunlight, and contact with these radicals is damaging to the fungus. Another unconventional chemical treatment involves treating with a solution of calcium silicate.[22] Silicon reportedly helps defend plants against fungal attack by degrading haustoria and by producing callose and papilla.\n\n### History\nPowdery mildews are thought to have first evolved in the Late Cretaceous,[23",

    "title": "Leaf Spot",
    "content": "### Description\nLeaf spots are a type of plant disease that are usually caused by pathogens and sometimes other cases such as herbicide injuries.[3] Leaf spots can vary in size, shape, and color depending on the age and type of the cause or pathogen. Plants, shrubs and trees are weakened by the spots on the leaves as they reduce available foliar space for photosynthesis. Other forms of leaf spot diseases include leaf rust, downy mildew and blights.[4] Although leaf spot diseases can affect a small percentage of the host's leaves, more severe consequences of leaf spot disease results in moderate to complete loss of leaves.[4]\n\n### Causes\nThe causes of leaf spots are mainly from fungi, bacteria, and viruses. However leaf spots may also be caused by abiotic factors such as environmental conditions, toxicities and herbicide injuries.[5] Foliar nematodes are another cause of leaf spots where the saliva injected into the cell walls during feeding results in the affected cells to discolour and become lesions.[6] Aphelenchoides are common foliar nematodes which produce angular leaf spots. The Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi affects chrysanthemum and other plants such as dry beans and bird's nest fern, and the Aphelenchoides fragariae affects strawberry and other ornamentals ferns.[6][7]\n\n### Fungi\nLeaf spots caused by fungi occur due to the necrosis of plant tissues. These necrotic lesions, localised in area and shape, consist of dead and collapsed cells of the host leaves.[1] One distinct feature of fungal infections is that there may be visible spores in the centre of leaf spots.[7] Fungal leaf spots often have a brown, black, tan or reddish centre with a darker margin and vary in size.[11]\n\n### Bacteria\nBacterial leaf spots show as necrotic, circular or angular  lesions and may have a yellowish outline or halo[7] Early symptoms of bacterial leaf spots show on older leaves and lesions appear water-soaked.[12] Bacterial spots affecting dicytyledounous plants that have net-like leaf veins sometimes take a more angular shape as they are restricted by the large leaf veins. Bacterial spots on monocotyledonous plants with parallel leaf veins have a streak or striped appearance.[7] The most obvious symptom of bacterial leaf spots are the blackening of the spots after infection. Eventually older lesions dry out and become papery in texture.[12] Bacterial spots can also produce white, yellow, light cream or silver bacterial exudate depending on the type of bacteria, which may ooze from splitting lesions and/or from the underside of the spots.[7] Bacterial leaf spots caused by Pseudomonas show red-brown spots which can distort the infected leaves, whilst those caused by Xanthomonas are angular or circular in shape outlined with a yellow halo.[13]\n\n### Virus\nLeaf spots are visible symptoms of virus infections on plants, and are referred to as systemic symptoms.[7] In systematic virus infections leaf spots caused by viruses show a loss of green colour in leaves, due to chlorosis which is a repression of chlorophyll development.[1] Leaves may yellow and have a mottled green or yellow appearance, show mosaic (e.g. chlorotic spotting) and ringspots (chlorotic or necrotic rings).[7] However, there are no signs of the viral pathogen itself, as compared to visible spores of fungal pathogens and bacterial ooze or water-soaked lesions of bacterial spots as the viruses are difficult to see and requires an electron microscope for detection.[5]\n\n### Herbicide\nLeaf spots may also be from injuries made by herbicides coming in contact with the plant. A low rate of contact from nitrile and pyridazine herbicides, can result in spotting or speckling of the plant's foliage. Diphenylether herbicides can result in reddish-colour spots shortly after application.[3] Accurate identification of leaf spot disease is needed as to distinguish signs of illness from damage done by herbicides.[10]\n\n### Effect On Transpiration\nTranspiration increases in affected plants. This is because in leaf spots, the plant cuticle, epidermis, and cell tissues, including the xylem may be destroyed in the infected areas. The cuticle protects the leaf and the destruction of these cell tissues results in an uncontrollable loss of water from the affected areas. This can result in wilting of leaves.[7]\n\n### Effect On Plant Growth\nLeaf spots reduce the surface area available on leaves for photosynthesis and so can result in smaller growth and yield of plants. Weakened plants may produce lesser fruit. Virus caused leaf spots reduces chlorophyll in the leaves, resulting in less photosynthetic activity. This can lead to smaller leaves and blossoms, smaller growth and reduced yield.[1]\n\n### Disease Cycle\nLeaf spot disease occurs when the following factors are all present: favourable environmental conditions, a pathogenic agent, and susceptible host.[2] Different types of pathogens, including fungal, bacterial and viral agents have unique ways to suppress and attack the host plant's immune system, thereby resulting in the progression of leaf spot disease. Knowing the disease cycle of each microbial agent also helps in managing leaf spot disease.[2] Fungal leaf spot pathogens follow the path of attaching to the plant surface, germinating via spores and entering into the host tissue. Colonisation of the host tissue follows and then the expression of symptoms.[14] Usually fungi will overwinter on fallen leaves, or buds, branches and fruits, then in the warmer early spring to summer months produce spores during the germination process, on the exterior of leaves, as well as exist as pycnidia, acervuli and perithecia, within the affected leaf tissue.[15] Viruses can survive in cells that have been infected by the viral agent called alternate hosts.[2] For infection to occur virus replication needs to happen, and in doing so uses the host cell's products, disrupting cell processes.[16] Horizontal transmission of viral pathogens include dispersal through touching of nearby infected leaves and through root systems or through vectors for more distant hosts.[16] Vertical transmission occurs by inheriting the virus from the parent host plant.[16] Bacterial pathogens survive in infected plants, plant debris, seed and soil.[8] Infection occurs when the bacteria enter into wounds, or by natural entry (cell adhesion), under favourable warm and moist conditions.[8]\n\n### Dispersion\nPathogens can be dispersed by the wind that can lift nematode eggs, insects, and many tiny fungal spores as well as bacterial cells by air currents.[2] Animal and insect vectors are another way in which fungal, bacterial and viral leaf spot diseases are spread.[2] Rainwater spreads pathogens by transporting infested soil into areas that are disease-free. Infested water can also be spread by way of irrigation or transplanting. Blowing rain can also spread fungi and bacteria.[2] Splashing water can also spread pathogens from the soil to leaf and amongst leaves.[8] Plant material can also be the cause of leaf spot disease. These include infected seeds, transplants and discarded culls and leaves.[2] Tools used by humans and worker's hands during transplants, watering, and market practices can contribute to the dispersal of leaf spot pathogens.[8]\n\n### Management\nCertain chemicals are used to treat leaf spot disease, such as the Bordeaux mixture, the first fungicide to have been developed, which treats many fungal and bacterial leaf spots.[7] Other fungicides such as zineb, chlorothalonil and Captan, also treat leaf spot disease and Benomyl specifically treats Cercospora leaf spots, cherry leaf spot and black spot of roses.[7] Thiabendazole is used to treat leaf spot diseases of turf and ornamentals.[7] Both fenarimol and nuarimol are pyrimidines that also treats leaf spot disease. More chemicals include Triazoles an organosphosphate fungicide, Imazalil, Procholora and Fentin hydroxide. Registered fungicides in use are thiophanate methyl, chlorothalonil, ferban and manco",

    "title": "Plant Disease Resistance",
    "content": "### Background\nPlant disease resistance is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel, and other inputs. Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but this has not always protected them. The late blight Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s was caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. The world's first mass-cultivated banana cultivar Gros Michel was lost in the 1920s to Panama disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. The current wheat stem rust, leaf rust, and yellow stripe rust epidemics spreading from East Africa into the Indian subcontinent are caused by rust fungi Puccinia graminis and P. striiformis. Other epidemics include chestnut blight, as well as recurrent severe plant diseases such as rice blast, soybean cyst nematode, and citrus canker.[1][2] Plant pathogens can spread rapidly over great distances, vectored by water, wind, insects, and humans. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed nations or agricultural systems, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings.[1] However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop rotation, pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and pesticide use.\n\n### Immune System\nThe plant immune system carries two interconnected tiers of receptors, one most frequently sensing molecules outside the cell and the other most frequently sensing molecules inside the cell. Both systems sense the intruder and respond by activating antimicrobial defenses in the infected cell and neighboring cells. In some cases, defense-activating signals spread to the rest of the plant or even to neighboring plants. The two systems detect different types of pathogen molecules and classes of plant receptor proteins.[5][6] The first tier is primarily governed by pattern recognition receptors that are activated by recognition of evolutionarily conserved pathogen or microbial–associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs). Activation of PRRs leads to intracellular signaling, transcriptional reprogramming, and biosynthesis of a complex output response that limits colonization. The system is known as PAMP-triggered immunity or as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI).[7][6][8] The second tier, primarily governed by R gene products, is often termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI is typically activated by the presence of specific pathogen \"effectors\" and then triggers strong antimicrobial responses (see R gene section below). In addition to PTI and ETI, plant defenses can be activated by the sensing of damage-associated compounds (DAMP), such as portions of the plant cell wall released during pathogenic infection.[9] Responses activated by PTI and ETI receptors include ion channel gating, oxidative burst, cellular redox changes, or protein kinase cascades that directly activate cellular changes (such as cell wall reinforcement or antimicrobial production), or activate changes in gene expression that then elevate other defensive responses. Plant immune systems show some mechanistic similarities with the immune systems of insects and mammals, but also exhibit many plant-specific characteristics.[10] The two above-described tiers are central to plant immunity but do not fully describe plant immune systems. In addition, many specific examples of apparent PTI or ETI violate common PTI/ETI definitions, suggesting a need for broadened definitions and/or paradigms.[11] The term quantitative resistance (discussed below) refers to plant disease resistance that is controlled by multiple genes and multiple molecular mechanisms that each have small effects on the overall resistance trait. Quantitative resistance is often contrasted to ETI resistance mediated by single major-effect R genes.\n\n### Pattern-Triggered Immunity\nPAMPs, conserved molecules that inhabit multiple pathogen genera, are referred to as MAMPs by many researchers. The defenses induced by MAMP perception are sufficient to repel most pathogens. However, pathogen effector proteins (see below) are adapted to suppress basal defenses such as PTI. Many receptors for MAMPs (and DAMPs) have been discovered. MAMPs and DAMPs are often detected by transmembrane receptor-kinases that carry LRR or LysM extracellular domains.[5]\n\n### Effector Triggered Immunity\nEffector triggered immunity (ETI) is activated by the presence of pathogen effectors. The ETI response is reliant on R genes, and is activated by specific pathogen strains. Plant ETI often causes an apoptotic hypersensitive response.\n\n### R Genes And R Proteins\nPlants have evolved R genes (resistance genes) whose products mediate resistance to specific virus, bacteria, oomycete, fungus, nematode or insect strains. R gene products are proteins that allow recognition of specific pathogen effectors, either through direct binding or by recognition of the effector's alteration of a host protein.[6] Many R genes encode NB-LRR proteins (proteins with nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domains, also known as NLR proteins or STAND proteins, among other names). Most plant immune systems carry a repertoire of 100–600 different R gene homologs. Individual R genes have been demonstrated to mediate resistance to specific virus, bacteria, oomycete, fungus, nematode or insect strains. R gene products control a broad set of disease resistance responses whose induction is often sufficient to stop further pathogen growth/spread. Studied R genes usually confer specificity for particular strains of a pathogen species (those that express the recognized effector). As first noted by Harold Flor in his mid-20th century formulation of the gene-for-gene relationship, a plant R gene has specificity for a pathogen avirulence gene (Avr gene). Avirulence genes are now known to encode effectors. The pathogen Avr gene must have matched specificity with the R gene for that R gene to confer resistance, suggesting a receptor/ligand interaction for Avr and R genes.[10] Alternatively, an effector can modify its host cellular target (or a molecular decoy of that target), and the R gene product (NLR protein) activates defenses when it detects the modified form of the host target or decoy.[6][12]\n\n### Effector Biology\nEffectors are central to the pathogenic or symbiotic potential of microbes and microscopic plant-colonizing animals such as nematodes.[13][14][15] Effectors typically are proteins that are delivered outside the microbe and into the host cell. These colonist-derived effectors manipulate the host's cell physiology and development. As such, effectors offer examples of co-evolution (example: a fungal protein that functions outside of the fungus but inside of plant cells has evolved to take on plant-specific functions). Pathogen host range is determined, among other things, by the presence of appropriate effectors that allow colonization of a particular host.[5] Pathogen-derived effectors are a powerful tool to identify plant functions that play key roles in disease and in disease resistance. Apparently most effectors function to manipulate host physiology to allow disease to occur. Well-studied bacterial plant pathogens typically express a few dozen effectors, often delivered into the host by a Type III secretion apparatus.[13] Fungal, oomycete and nematode plant pathogens apparently express a few hundred effectors.[14][15] So-called \"core\" effectors are defined operationally by their wide distribution across the population of a particular pathogen and their substantial contribution to pathogen virulence. Genomics can be used to identify core effectors, which can then be used to discover new R gene",

    "title": "Rainwater Harvesting",
    "content": "### Domestic Use\nRooftop rainwater harvesting is used to provide drinking water, domestic water, water for livestock, water for small irrigation, and a way to replenish groundwater levels.[10][11] Kenya has already been successfully harvesting rainwater for toilets, laundry, and irrigation. Since the establishment of the 2016 Water Act, Kenya has prioritized regulating its agriculture industry.[12] Additionally, areas in Australia use harvested rainwater for cooking and drinking.[13] Studies by Stout et al. on the feasibility of RWH in India found it most beneficial for small-scale irrigation, which provides income from produce sales, and for groundwater recharge.[13]\n\n### Agriculture\nIn regards to urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting in urban areas reduces the impact of runoff and flooding. The combination of urban 'green' rooftops with rainwater catchments have been found to reduce building temperatures by more than 1.3 degrees Celsius. Rainwater harvesting in conjunction with urban agriculture would be a viable way to help meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for cleaner and sustainable cities, health and wellbeing, and food and water security (Sustainable Development Goal 6). The technology is available, however, it needs to be remodeled in order to use water more efficiently, especially in an urban setting. Missions to five Caribbean countries have shown that the capture and storage of rainwater runoff for later use is able to significantly reduce the risk of losing some or all of the year's harvest because of soil or water scarcity. In addition, the risks associated with flooding and soil erosion during high rainfall seasons would decrease. Small farmers, especially those farming on hillsides, could benefit the most from rainwater harvesting because they are able to capture runoff and decrease the effects of soil erosion.[14] Many countries, especially those with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water.[15] To enhance irrigation in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills and slopes. Even in periods of low rainfall, enough water is collected for crops to grow.[16] Water can be collected from roofs, dams and ponds can be constructed to hold large quantities of rainwater so that even on days when little to no rainfall occurs, enough is available to irrigate crops.\n\n### Industry\nFrankfurt Airport has the largest rainwater harvesting system in Germany, saving approximately 1 million cubic meters of water per year. The cost of the system was 1.5 million dm (US$63,000) in 1993. This system collects water from the roofs of the new terminal which has an area of 26,800 square meters. The water is collected in the basement of the airport in six tanks with a storage capacity of 100 cubic meters. The water is mainly used for toilet flushing, watering plants and cleaning the air conditioning system.[17] Rainwater harvesting was adopted at The Velodrome – The London Olympic Park – in order to increase the sustainability of the facility. A 73% decrease in potable water demand by the park was estimated. Despite this, it was deemed that rainwater harvesting was a less efficient use of financial resources to increase sustainability than the park's blackwater recycling program.[18]\n\n### Technologies\nTraditionally, stormwater management using detention basins served a single purpose. However, optimized real-time control lets this infrastructure double as a source of rainwater harvesting without compromising the existing detention capacity.[19] This has been used in the EPA headquarters to evacuate stored water prior to storm events, thus reducing wet weather flow while ensuring water availability for later reuse. This has the benefit of increasing water quality released and decreasing the volume of water released during combined sewer overflow events.[20][21] Generally, check dams are constructed across the streams to enhance the percolation of surface water into the subsoil strata. The water percolation in the water-impounded area of the check dams can be enhanced artificially manyfold by loosening the subsoil strata by using  ANFO explosives as used in open cast mining. Thus, local aquifers can be recharged quickly using the available surface water fully for use in the dry season.\n\n### System Setup\nRainwater harvesting systems can range in complexity, from systems that can be installed with minimal skills, to automated systems that require advanced setup and installation. The basic rainwater harvesting system is more of a plumbing job than a technical job, as all the outlets from the building's terrace are connected through a pipe to an underground tank that stores water. There are common components that are installed in such systems, such as pre-filters (see e.g. vortex filter), drains/gutters, storage containers, and depending on whether the system is pressurized, also pumps, and treatment devices such as UV lights, chlorination devices and post-filtration equipment. Systems are ideally sized to meet the water demand throughout the dry season since it must be big enough to support daily water consumption. Specifically, the rainfall capturing area such as a building roof must be large enough to maintain an adequate flow of water. The water storage tank size should be large enough to contain the captured water. \nFor low-tech systems, many low-tech methods are used to capture rainwater: rooftop systems, surface water capture, and pumping the rainwater that has already soaked into the ground or captured in reservoirs and storing it in tanks (cisterns).\n\n### Rainwater Harvesting By Solar Power Panels\nGood quality water resources near populated areas are becoming scarce and costly for consumers. In addition to solar and wind energy, rainwater is a major renewable resource for any land. Vast areas are being covered by solar PV panels every year in all parts of the world. Solar panels can also be used for harvesting most of the rainwater falling on them and drinking quality water, free from bacteria and suspended matter, can be generated by simple filtration and disinfection processes as rainwater is very low in salinity.[22][23][24] Exploiting rainwater for value-added products like bottled drinking water makes solar PV power plants profitable even in high rainfall or cloudy areas by generating additional income. Recently, cost-effective rainwater collection in existing wells has been found highly effective in raising groundwater levels in India.\n\n### Other Innovations\nThe Groasis Waterboxx is an example of low scale technology, in this case to assist planting of trees in arid area. It harvests rainwater and dew. Global Rainwater Management Program (GRMP) suggested by UNCCD and Global Water Partnership Global Rainwater Management Program (GRMP)\n\n### Advantages\nRainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply during regional water restrictions, and in developed countries, it is often used to supplement the main supply. It provides water when a drought occurs, can help mitigate flooding of low-lying areas, and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained. Rainwater harvesting increases the availability of water during dry seasons by increasing the levels of dried borewells and wells. Surface water supply is readily available for various purposes thus reducing dependence on underground water. It improves the quality of ground by diluting salinity. It does not cause pollution and is environmentally friendly. It is cost-effective and easily affordable. It also helps in the availability of potable water, as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts. Applications of rainwater harvesting in urban water system provides a substantial benefit for both water supply and wastewater subsystems by reducing the need for clean water in water distribution systems, less generated stormwater in sew",

    "content": "### Natural Sources Of Fresh Water\nNatural sources of fresh water include surface water, under river flow, groundwater and frozen water.\n\n### Surface Water\nSurface water is water in a river, lake or fresh water wetland. Surface water is naturally replenished by precipitation and naturally lost through discharge to the oceans, evaporation, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. The only natural input to any surface water system is precipitation within its watershed. The total quantity of water in that system at any given time is also dependent on many other factors. These factors include storage capacity in lakes, wetlands and artificial reservoirs, the permeability of the soil beneath these storage bodies, the runoff characteristics of the land in the watershed, the timing of the precipitation and local evaporation rates. All of these factors also affect the proportions of water loss. Humans often increase storage capacity by constructing reservoirs and decrease it by draining wetlands. Humans often increase runoff quantities and velocities by paving areas and channelizing the stream flow. Natural surface water can be augmented by importing surface water from another watershed through a canal or pipeline. Brazil is estimated to have the largest supply of fresh water in the world, followed by Russia and Canada.[4] Glacier runoff is considered to be surface water. The Himalayas, which are often called \"The Roof of the World\", contain some of the most extensive and rough high altitude areas on Earth as well as the greatest area of glaciers and permafrost outside of the poles. Ten of Asia's largest rivers flow from there, and more than a billion people's livelihoods depend on them. To complicate matters, temperatures there are rising more rapidly than the global average. In Nepal, the temperature has risen by 0.6 degrees Celsius over the last decade, whereas globally, the Earth has warmed approximately 0.7 degrees Celsius over the last hundred years.[5]\n\n### Groundwater\nGroundwater is the water present beneath Earth's surface in rock and soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. About 30 percent of all readily available fresh water in the world is groundwater.[6] A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from the surface; it may discharge from the surface naturally at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology. Throughout the course of a river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the visible free water flow together with a substantial contribution flowing through rocks and sediments that underlie the river and its floodplain called the hyporheic zone. For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow. The hyporheic zone often forms a dynamic interface between surface water and groundwater from aquifers, exchanging flow between rivers and aquifers that may be fully charged or depleted. This is especially significant in karst areas where pot-holes and underground rivers are common.\n\n### Artificial Sources Of Usable Water\nThere are several artificial sources of fresh water. One is treated wastewater (reclaimed water). Another is atmospheric water generators.[7][8][9] Desalinated seawater is another important source. It is important to consider the economic and environmental side effects of these technologies.[10]\n\n### Wastewater Reuse\nWater reclamation is the process of converting municipal wastewater or sewage and industrial wastewater into water that can be reused for a variety of purposes. It is also called wastewater reuse, water reuse or water recycling. There are many types of reuse. It is possible to reuse water in this way in cities or for irrigation in agriculture. Other types of reuse are environmental reuse, industrial reuse, and reuse for drinking water, whether planned or not. Reuse may include irrigation of gardens and agricultural fields or replenishing surface water and groundwater. This latter is also known as groundwater recharge. Reused water also serve various needs in residences such as toilet flushing, businesses, and industry. It is possible to treat wastewater to reach drinking water standards. Injecting reclaimed water into the water supply distribution system is known as direct potable reuse. Drinking reclaimed water is not typical.[11] Reusing treated municipal wastewater for irrigation is a long-established practice. This is especially so in arid countries. Reusing wastewater as part of sustainable water management allows water to remain an alternative water source for human activities. This can reduce scarcity. It also eases pressures on groundwater and other natural water bodies.[12]\n\n### Desalinated Water\nDesalination is an artificial process by which saline water (generally sea water) is converted to fresh water. More generally, desalination is the removal of salts and minerals from a substance.[15] It is possible to desalinate saltwater, especially sea water, to produce water for human consumption or irrigation, producing brine as a by-product.[16] Interest in desalination mostly focuses on cost-effective provision of fresh water for human use. Along with recycled wastewater, it is one of the few water resources independent of rainfall.[17] As stress on the need for freshwater intensifies globally, desalination has become a key part of strategies for global water security. According to a 2019 review in Science of the Total Environment, around 95 million cubic meters per day of desalinated water is produced worldwide, and the demand for desalinated water is expected to grow significantly to help close the global water supply gap.\n\n### Research Into Other Options\nResearchers proposed air capture over oceans which would \"significantly increasing freshwater through the capture of humid air over oceans\" to address present and, especially, future water scarcity/insecurity.[24][23] A 2021 study proposed hypothetical portable solar-powered atmospheric water harvesting devices. However, such off-the-grid generation may sometimes \"undermine efforts to develop permanent piped infrastructure\" among other problems.[25][26][27]\n\n### Water Uses\nThe total quantity of water available at any given time is an important consideration. Some human water users have an intermittent need for water. For example, many farms require large quantities of water in the spring, and no water at all in the winter. Other users have a continuous need for water, such as a power plant that requires water for cooling. Over the long term the average rate of precipitation within a watershed is the upper bound for average consumption of natural surface water from that watershed.\n\n### Agriculture And Other Irrigation\nIrrigation is the practice of applying controlled amounts of water to land to help grow crops, landscape plants, and lawns. Irrigation has been a key aspect of agriculture for over 5,000 years and has been developed by many cultures around the world. Irrigation helps to grow crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during times of below-average rainfall. In addition to these uses, irrigation is also employed to protect crops from frost,[28] suppress weed growth in grain fields, and prevent soil consolidation. It is also used to cool livestock, reduce dust, dispose of sewage, and support mining operations. Drainage, which involves the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given location, is often studied in conjunction with irrig",

    "content": "### Definition\nGroundwater is fresh water located in the subsurface pore space of soil and rocks. It is also water that is flowing within aquifers below the water table. Sometimes it is useful to make a distinction between groundwater that is closely associated with surface water, and deep groundwater in an aquifer (called \"fossil water\" if it infiltrated into the ground millennia ago[8]).\n\n### Role In The Water Cycle\nGroundwater can be thought of in the same terms as surface water: inputs, outputs and storage. The natural input to groundwater is infiltration from surface water, which must then percolate downward to reach the groundwater.  The natural outputs from groundwater are springs and seepage to the oceans.[9]  Groundwater storage can be much larger (in volume) compared to its inputs than surface water and have a slower turnover rate, though this depends on the features of the aquifer.[10]  This difference makes it easy for humans to use groundwater unsustainably for a long time without severe consequences. Nevertheless, over the long term the average rate of infiltration above a groundwater source plus input from streams is the upper bound for average consumption of water from that source.[11][12] Groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from precipitation, streams, and rivers when this recharge reaches the water table.[13] Groundwater can be a long-term 'reservoir' of the natural water cycle (with residence times from days to millennia),[14][15] as opposed to short-term water reservoirs like the atmosphere and fresh surface water (which have residence times from minutes to years). Deep groundwater (which is quite distant from the surface recharge) can take a very long time to complete its natural cycle. The Great Artesian Basin in central and eastern Australia is one of the largest confined aquifer systems in the world, extending for almost 2 million km2. By analysing the trace elements in water sourced from deep underground, hydrogeologists have been able to determine that water extracted from these aquifers can be more than 1 million years old. By comparing the age of groundwater obtained from different parts of the Great Artesian Basin, hydrogeologists have found it increases in age across the basin. Where water recharges the aquifers along the Eastern Divide, ages are young. As groundwater flows westward across the continent, it increases in age, with the oldest groundwater occurring in the western parts. This means that in order to have travelled almost 1000 km from the source of recharge in 1 million years, the groundwater flowing through the Great Artesian Basin travels at an average rate of about 1 metre per year.\n\n### Groundwater Recharge\nGroundwater recharge or deep drainage or deep percolation is a hydrologic process, where water moves downward from surface water to groundwater. Recharge is the primary method through which water enters an aquifer. This process usually occurs in the vadose zone below plant roots and is often expressed as a flux to the water table surface. Groundwater recharge also encompasses water moving away from the water table farther into the saturated zone.[16] Recharge occurs both naturally (through the water cycle) and through anthropogenic processes (i.e., \"artificial groundwater recharge\"), where rainwater and/or reclaimed water is routed to the subsurface.\n\n### Temperature\nThe high specific heat capacity of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effects of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature. In some places where groundwater temperatures are maintained by this effect at about 10 °C (50 °F), groundwater can be used for controlling the temperature inside structures at the surface. For example, during hot weather relatively cool groundwater can be pumped through radiators in a home and then returned to the ground in another well. During cold seasons, because it is relatively warm, the water can be used in the same way as a source of heat for heat pumps that is much more efficient than using air.\n\n### Availability\nGroundwater makes up about thirty percent of the world's fresh water supply, which is about 0.76% of the entire world's water, including oceans and permanent ice.[19][20] About 99% of the world's liquid fresh water is groundwater.[21] Global groundwater storage is roughly equal to the total amount of freshwater stored in the snow and ice pack, including the north and south poles. This makes it an important resource that can act as a natural storage that can buffer against shortages of surface water, as in during times of drought.[22] The volume of groundwater in an aquifer can be estimated by measuring water levels in local wells and by examining geologic records from well-drilling to determine the extent, depth and thickness of water-bearing sediments and rocks. Before an investment is made in production wells, test wells may be drilled to measure the depths at which water is encountered and collect samples of soils, rock and water for laboratory analyses. Pumping tests can be performed in test wells to determine flow characteristics of the aquifer.[3] The characteristics of aquifers vary with the geology and structure of the substrate and topography in which they occur. In general, the more productive aquifers occur in sedimentary geologic formations. By comparison, weathered and fractured crystalline rocks yield smaller quantities of groundwater in many environments. Unconsolidated to poorly cemented alluvial materials that have accumulated as valley-filling sediments in major river valleys and geologically subsiding structural basins are included among the most productive sources of groundwater. Fluid flows can be altered in different lithological settings by brittle deformation of rocks in fault zones; the mechanisms by which this occurs are the subject of fault zone hydrogeology.[23]\n\n### Uses By Humans\nReliance on groundwater will only increase, mainly due to growing water demand by all sectors combined with increasing variation in rainfall patterns.[24] Safe use of groundwater varies substantially by the elements present and use-cases, with significant differences between consumption for humans, livestocks and different crops.[25]\n\n### Quantities\nGroundwater is the most accessed source of freshwater around the world, including as drinking water, irrigation, and manufacturing. Groundwater accounts for about half of the world's drinking water, 40% of its irrigation water, and a third of water for industrial purposes.[21] Another estimate stated that globally groundwater accounts for about one third of all water withdrawals, and surface water for the other two thirds.[26]: 21  Groundwater provides drinking water to at least 50% of the global population.[27] About 2.5 billion people depend solely on groundwater resources to satisfy their basic daily water needs.[27] A similar estimate was published in 2021 which stated that \"groundwater is estimated to supply between a quarter and a third of the world's annual freshwater withdrawals to meet agricultural, industrial and domestic demands.\"[28]: 1091 Global freshwater withdrawal was probably around 600 km3 per year in 1900 and increased to 3,880 km3 per year in 2017. The rate of increase was especially high (around 3% per year) during the period 1950–1980, partly due to a higher population growth rate, and partly to rapidly increasing groundwater development, particularly for irrigation. The rate of increase is (as per 2022) approximately 1% per year, in tune with the current population growth rate.[24]: 15 Global groundwater depletion has been calculated to be between 100 and 300 km3 per year. This depletion is mainly caused by \"expansion of irrigated agriculture in drylands\".[28]: 1091 The Asia-Pacific region is the largest groundwater abstractor in the world, containing seven out of the ten countries that extract most groundwater (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iran",

After certain practices are installed, it is important to continuously monitor these systems to ensure that they are working properly in terms of improving environmental quality.[2] In urban settings, managing areas to prevent soil loss and control stormwater flow are a few of the areas that receive attention. A few practices that are used to manage stormwater before it reaches a channel are retention ponds, filtering systems and wetlands. It is important that storm-water is given an opportunity to infiltrate so that the soil and vegetation can act as a \"filter\" before the water reaches nearby streams or lakes. In the case of soil erosion prevention, a few common practices include the use of silt fences, landscape fabric with grass seed and hydroseeding. The main objective in all cases is to slow water movement to prevent soil transport.\n\n### Governance\nThe 2nd  World Water Forum held in The Hague in March 2000 raised some controversies that exposed the multilateral nature and imbalance the demand and supply management of freshwater. While donor organizations, private and government institutions backed by the World Bank, believe that freshwater should be governed as an economic good by appropriate pricing, NGOs however, held that freshwater resources should be seen as a social good.[3] The concept of network governance where all stakeholders form partnerships and voluntarily share ideas towards forging a common vision can be used to resolve this clash of opinion in freshwater management. Also, the implementation of any common vision presents a new role for NGOs because of their unique capabilities in local community coordination, thus making them a valuable partner in network governance.[4] Watersheds replicate this multilateral terrain with private industries and local communities interconnected by a common watershed. Although these groups share a common ecological space that could transcend state borders, their interests, knowledge and use of resources within the watershed are mostly disproportionate and divergent, resulting to the activities of a specific group adversely impacting on other groups. Examples being the Minamata Bay poisoning that occurred from 1932 to 1968, killing over 1,784 individuals and the Wabigoon River incidence of 1962. Furthermore, while some knowledgeable groups are shifting from efficient water resource exploitation to efficient utilization, net gain for the watershed ecology could be lost when other groups seize the opportunity to exploit more resources. Moreover, the need to create partnerships between donor organizations, private and government institutions and community representatives like NGOs in watersheds is to enhance an \"organizational society\" among stakeholders.[5] Several riparian states have adopted this concept in managing the increasingly scarce resources of watersheds. These include the nine Rhine states, with a common vision of pollution control,[6] the Lake Chad and river Nile Basins, whose common vision is to ensure environmental sustainability.[7] As a partner in the commonly shared vision, NGOs has adopted a new role in operationalizing the implementation of regional watershed management policies at the local level. For instance, essential local coordination and education are areas where the services of NGOs have been effective.[8] This makes NGOs the \"nuclei\" for successful watershed management.[4] Recently, artificial Intelligence techniques such as neural networks have been utilized to address the problem of watershed management.[9]\n\n### Environmental Law\nEnvironmental laws often dictate the planning and actions that agencies take to manage watersheds. Some laws require that planning be done, others can be used to make a plan legally enforceable and others set out the ground rules for what can and cannot be done in development and planning. Most countries and states have their own laws regarding watershed management. Those concerned about aquatic habitat protection have a right to participate in the laws and planning processes that affect aquatic habitats. By having a clear understanding of whom to speak to and how to present the case for keeping our waterways clean a member of the public can become an effective watershed protection advocate.",

    "title": "Drought",
    "content": "### Definition\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines a drought simply as \"drier than normal conditions\".[1]: 1157  This means that a drought is \"a moisture deficit relative to the average water availability at a given location and season\".[1]: 1157 According to National Integrated Drought Information System, a multi-agency partnership, drought is generally defined as \"a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time (usually a season or more), resulting in a water shortage\". The National Weather Service office of the NOAA defines drought as \"a deficiency of moisture that results in adverse impacts on people, animals, or vegetation over a sizeable area\".[16] Drought is a complex phenomenon − relating to the absence of water − which is difficult to monitor and define.[17] By the early 1980s, over 150 definitions of \"drought\" had already been published.[18] The range of definitions reflects differences in regions, needs, and disciplinary approaches.\n\n### Categories\nThere are three major categories of drought based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and agricultural or ecological drought.[1]: 1157  A meteorological drought occurs due to lack of precipitation. A hydrological drought is related to low runoff, streamflow, and reservoir and groundwater storage.[19] An agricultural or ecological drought is causing plant stress from a combination of evaporation and low soil moisture.[1]: 1157  Some organizations add another category: socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply as a result of a weather-related shortfall in water supply.[17][18] The socioeconomic drought is a similar concept to water scarcity. The different categories of droughts have different causes but similar effects:\n\n### Indices And Monitoring\nSeveral indices have been defined to quantify and monitor drought at different spatial and temporal scales. A key property of drought indices is their spatial comparability, and they must be statistically robust.[26] Drought indices include:[26] High-resolution drought information helps to better assess the spatial and temporal changes and variability in drought duration, severity, and magnitude at a much finer scale. This supports the development of site-specific adaptation measures.[26] The application of multiple indices using different datasets helps to better manage and monitor droughts than using a single dataset, This is particularly the case in regions of the world where not enough data is available such as Africa and South America. Using a single dataset can be limiting, as it may not capture the full spectrum of drought characteristics and impacts.[26] Careful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires.\n\n### General Precipitation Deficiency\nMechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform,[31] and orographic rainfall.[32] Convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation,[33] while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer duration.[34] Precipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice. Droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are, in themselves, low. If these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficiently to reach the surface over a sufficient time, the result is a drought. Drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems, winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses, and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Once a region is within drought, feedback mechanisms such as local arid air,[35] hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging,[36] and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions. Within the tropics, distinct, wet and dry seasons emerge due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone or Monsoon trough.[37] The dry season greatly increases drought occurrence,[38] and is characterized by its low humidity, with watering holes and rivers drying up. Because of the lack of these watering holes, many grazing animals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water in search of more fertile lands. Examples of such animals are zebras, elephants, and wildebeest. Because of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are common.[39] Since water vapor becomes more energetic with increasing temperature, more water vapor is required to increase relative humidity values to 100% at higher temperatures (or to get the temperature to fall to the dew point).[40] Periods of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable production,[41] increase evaporation and transpiration from plants,[42] and worsen drought conditions.[43] The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon can sometimes play a significant role in drought. ENSO comprises two patterns of temperature anomalies in the central Pacific Ocean, known as La Niña and El Niño. La Niña events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of drought in California and the Southwestern United States, and to some extent the U.S. Southeast. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Niñas have become more frequent over time.[44] Conversely, during El Niño events, drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America. Winters during the El Niño are warmer and drier than average conditions in the Northwest, northern Midwest, and northern Mideast United States, so those regions experience reduced snowfalls. Conditions are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana. Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in parts of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, increasing bush fires, worsening haze, and decreasing air quality dramatically. Drier-than-normal conditions are also in general observed in Queensland, inland Victoria, inland New South Wales, and eastern Tasmania from June to August. As warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, it causes extensive drought in the western Pacific. Singapore experienced the driest February in 2014 since records began in 1869, with only 6.3 mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35 °C on 26 February. The years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4 mm of rain fell.[45]\n\n### Climate Change\nGlobally, the occurrence of droughts has increased as a result of the increase in temperature and atmospheric evaporative demand. In addition, increased climate variability has increased the frequency and severity of drought events. Moreover, the occurrence and impact of droughts are aggravated by anthropogenic activities such as land use change and water management and demand.[26] The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report also pointed out that \"Warming over land drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand and in the severity of drought events\"[47]: 1057  and \"Increased atmospheric evaporative demand increases plant water stress, leading to agricultural and ecological drought\".[48]: 578 There is a rise of compound warm-season droughts in Europe that are concurrent with an increase in potential evapotranspiration.[49] Climate change affects many factors associated with droughts. These include how much rain falls and how fast the rain evaporates again. Warming over land increases the severity and frequency of droughts around much of the world.[50][51]: 1057  In some tropical and subtropical regions of the world, there will probably be le",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe Old English word for barley was bere.[4] This survives in the north of Scotland as bere; it is used for a strain of six-row barley grown there.[5] Modern English barley derives from the Old English adjective bærlic, meaning \"of barley\".[3][6] The word barn derives from Old English bere-aern meaning \"barley-store\".[3]\nThe name of the genus is from Latin hordeum, barley, likely related to Latin horrere, to bristle.[7]\n\n### Description\nBarley is a cereal, a member of the grass family with edible grains. Its flowers are clusters of spikelets arranged in a distinctive herringbone pattern. Each spikelet has a long thin awn (to 160 mm (6.3 in) long), making the ears look tufted. The spikelets are in clusters of three. In six-row barley, all three spikelets in each cluster are fertile; in two-row barley, only the central one is fertile.[8] It is a self-pollinating, diploid species with 14 chromosomes.[9] The genome of barley was sequenced in 2012 by the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium and the UK Barley Sequencing Consortium.[10] The genome is organised into seven pairs[11] of nuclear chromosomes (recommended designations: 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H and 7H), and one mitochondrial and one chloroplast chromosome, with a total of 5000 Mbp.[12] Details of the genome are freely available in several barley databases.[13]\n\n### External Phylogeny\nThe barley genus Hordeum is relatively closely related to wheat and rye within the Triticeae, and more distantly to rice within the BOP clade of grasses (Poaceae).[14] The phylogeny of the Triticeae is complicated by hybridization between species, so there is a network of relationships rather than a simple inheritance-based tree.[15] Bambusoideae (bamboos) (fescue, ryegrass) Hordeum (barley) Triticum (wheat) Secale (rye) Oryza (rice) other grasses Sorghum (sorghum) Zea (maize)\n\n### Domestication\nBarley was one of the first grains to be domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, an area of relatively abundant water in Western Asia,[17] around 9,000 BC.[16][18] Wild barley (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) ranges from North Africa and Crete in the west to Tibet in the east.[9] A study of genome-wide diversity markers found Tibet  to be an additional center of domestication of cultivated barley.[19] The earliest archaeological evidence of the consumption of wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum, comes from the Epipaleolithic at Ohalo II at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee, where grinding stones with traces of starch were found. The remains were dated to about 23,000 BC.[9][20][21] The earliest evidence for the domestication of barley, in the form of cultivars that cannot reproduce without human assistance, comes from Mesopotamia, specifically the Jarmo region of modern-day Iraq, around 9,000–7,000 BC.[22][23] Domestication changed the morphology of the barley grain substantially, from an elongated shape to a more rounded spherical one.[24] Wild barley has distinctive genes, alleles, and regulators with potential for resistance to abiotic or biotic stresses; these may help cultivated barley to adapt to climatic changes.[25] Wild barley has a brittle spike; upon maturity, the spikelets separate, facilitating seed dispersal. Domesticated barley has nonshattering spikelets, making it much easier to harvest the mature ears.[9] The nonshattering condition is caused by a mutation in one of two tightly linked genes known as Bt1 and Bt2; many cultivars possess both mutations. The nonshattering condition is recessive, so varieties of barley that exhibit this condition are homozygous for the mutant allele.[9] Domestication in barley is followed by the change of key phenotypic traits at the genetic level.[26] The wild barley found currently in the Fertile Crescent may not be the progenitor of the barley cultivated in Eritrea and Ethiopia, indicating that it may have been domesticated separately in eastern Africa.[27]\n\n### Spread\nArchaeobotanical evidence shows that barley had spread throughout Eurasia by 2,000 BC.[16] Genetic analysis demonstrates that cultivated barley followed several different routes over time.[16] By 4200 BC domesticated barley had reached Eastern Finland.[28] Barley has been grown in the Korean Peninsula since the Early Mumun Pottery Period (circa 1500–850 BC).[29] Barley (Yava in Sanskrit) is mentioned many times in the Rigveda and other Indian scriptures as a principal grain in ancient India.[30] Traces of barley cultivation have been found in post-Neolithic Bronze Age Harappan civilization 5,700–3,300 years ago.[31] Barley beer was probably one of the first alcoholic drinks developed by Neolithic humans;[32] later it was used as currency.[32] The Sumerian language had a word for barley, akiti. In ancient Mesopotamia, a stalk of barley was the primary symbol of the goddess Shala.[33] Rations of barley for workers appear in Linear B tablets in Mycenaean contexts at Knossos and at Mycenaean Pylos.[34] In mainland Greece, the ritual significance of barley possibly dates back to the earliest stages of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The preparatory kykeon or mixed drink of the initiates, prepared from barley and herbs, mentioned in the Homeric hymn to Demeter. The goddess's name may have meant \"barley-mother\", incorporating the ancient Cretan word δηαί (dēai), \"barley\".[35][36] The practice was to dry the barley groats and roast them before preparing the porridge, according to Pliny the Elder's Natural History.[37] Tibetan barley has been a staple food in Tibetan cuisine since the fifth century AD. This grain, along with a cool climate that permitted storage, produced a civilization that was able to raise great armies.[38] It is made into a flour product called tsampa that is still a staple in Tibet.[39] In medieval Europe, bread made from barley and rye was peasant food, while wheat products were consumed by the upper classes.[40]\n\n### Two-Row And Six-Row Barley\nSpikelets are arranged in triplets which alternate along the rachis. In wild barley (and other Old World species of Hordeum), only the central spikelet is fertile, while the other two are reduced. This condition is retained in certain cultivars known as two-row barleys. A pair of mutations (one dominant, the other recessive) result in fertile lateral spikelets to produce six-row barleys.[9] A mutation in one gene, vrs1, is responsible for the transition from two-row to six-row barley.[41] Brewers in Europe tend to use two-row cultivars and breweries in North America use six-row barley (or a mix), and there are important differences in enzyme content, kernel shape, and other factors that malters and brewers must take into consideration.[42] In traditional taxonomy, different forms of barley were classified as different species based on morphological differences. Two-row barley with shattering spikes (wild barley) was named Hordeum spontaneum. Two-row barley with nonshattering spikes was named as H. distichon, six-row barley with nonshattering spikes as H. vulgare (or H. hexastichum), and six-row with shattering spikes as H. agriocrithon. Because these differences were driven by single-gene mutations, coupled with cytological and molecular evidence, most recent classifications treat these forms as a single species, H. vulgare.[9]\n\n### Hulless Barley\nHulless or \"naked\" barley (Hordeum vulgare  var. nudum) is a form of domesticated barley with an easier-to-remove hull. Naked barley is an ancient food crop, but a new industry has developed around uses of selected hulless barley to increase the digestibility of the grain, especially for pigs and poultry.[43] Hulless barley has been investigated for several potential new applications as whole grain, bran, and flour.[44] Hulless barley can offer higher protein, increased beta-glucan content, and more efficient handling and processing because of the lack of hull.[45][46]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of barley was 146 million tonnes, led by Russia accounting for 14% of the world total (tabl",

    "content": "### Description\nThe oat is a tall stout grass, a member of the family Poaceae; it can grow to a height of 1.8 metres (5.9 ft). The leaves are long, narrow, and pointed, and grow upwards; they can be some 15 to 40 centimetres (5.9 to 15.7 in) in length, and around 5 to 15 millimetres (0.20 to 0.59 in) in width. Leaf blades emerge first from nodes in the stalk, then the sheath. New leaves grow upwards on nodes further from the ground, leaves on the old nodes gradually brown and wilt.[1]: 55–56 At the top of the stem, the plant branches into a loose cluster or panicle of spikelets. These contain the wind-pollinated flowers, which mature into the oat seeds or grains.[1]: 69–71 [2] Botanically the grain is a caryopsis, as the wall of the fruit is fused on to the actual seed. Like other cereal grains, the caryopsis contains the outer husk or bran, the starchy food store or endosperm which occupies most of the seed, and the protein-rich germ which if planted in soil can grow into a new plant.[3]\n\n### Phylogeny\nPhylogenetic analysis using molecular DNA and morphological evidence places the oat genus Avena in the Pooideae subfamily. That subfamily includes the cereals wheat, barley, and rye; they are in the Triticeae tribe, while Avena is in the Poeae, along with grasses such as Briza and Agrostis.[4] The wild ancestor of Avena sativa and the closely related minor crop – A. byzantina – is A. sterilis, a naturally hexaploid wild oat, one that has its DNA in six sets of chromosomes. Genetic evidence shows that the ancestral forms of A. sterilis grew in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East.[5][6] Analysis of maternal lineages of 25 Avena species using chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA showed that A. sativa's hexaploid  genome derives from three diploid oat species (each with two sets of chromosomes); the sets are dubbed A, B, C, and D. The diploid species are the CC A. ventricosa, the AA A. canariensis, and the AA A. longiglumis, along with two tetraploid oats (each with four sets), namely the AACC A. insularis and the AABB A. agadiriana. Tetraploids were formed as much as 10.6 mya, and hexaploids as much as 7.4 mya.[7]\n\n### Domestication\nGenomic study suggests that the hulled variety and the naked variety A. sativa var. nuda diverged around 51,200 years ago, long before domestication. This implies that the two varieties were domesticated independently.[8] Oats are thought to have emerged as a secondary crop. This means that they are derived from what was considered a weed of the primary cereal domesticates such as wheat. They survived as a Vavilovian mimic by having grains that Neolithic people found hard to distinguish from the primary crop.[6][9][10] Oats were cultivated for some thousands of years before they were domesticated. A granary from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, about 11,400 to 11,200 years ago in the Jordan Valley in the Middle East contained a large number of wild oat grains (120,000 seeds of A. sterilis). The find implies intentional cultivation. Domesticated oat grains first appear in the archaeological record in Europe around 3000 years ago.[6][8][11] Oat seed dispersal is facilitated by two awns that are part of each seed head. After falling to the ground, these long, slender structures twist as they dry in sun and as they are re-moistened by dew and rain. As a result, the seeds moved along the ground until falling into gaps in the soil, essentially planting themselves. Domestication has selected for loss of awns, since seeds are now planted by humans, and larger seeds.[12]\n\n### Cultivation\nOats are annual plants best grown in temperate regions.[2] They tolerate cold winters less well than wheat, rye, or barley; they are harmed by sustained cold below −7 °C (20 °F).[13] They have a lower summer heat requirement and greater tolerance of (and need for) rain than the other cereals mentioned, so they are particularly important in areas with cool, wet summers, such as Northwest Europe.[2][14] Oats can grow in most fertile, drained soils, being tolerant of a wide variety of soil types. Although better yields are achieved at a soil pH of 5.3 to 5.7, oats can tolerate soils with a pH as low as 4.5. They are better able to grow in low-nutrient soils than wheat or maize, but generally are less tolerant of high soil salinity than other cereals.[15] Traditionally, US farmers grew oats alongside red clover and alfalfa, which fixed nitrogen and provided animal forage. With less use of horses and more use of fertilizers, growth of these crops in the US declined. For example, the state of Iowa led US oat production until 1989, but has largely switched to maize and soybeans.[16]\n\n### Weeds, Pests, And Diseases\nOats can outcompete many weeds, as they grow thickly (with many leafy shoots) and vigorously, but are still subject to some broadleaf weeds. Control can be by herbicides, or by integrated pest management with measures such as sowing seed that is free of weeds.[17] Oats are relatively free from diseases. Nonetheless, they suffer from some leaf diseases, such as stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. avenae) and crown rust (P. coronata var. avenae).[18] \nCrown rust infection can greatly reduce photosynthesis and overall physiological activities of oat leaves, thereby reducing growth and crop yield.[19][20]\n\n### Processing\nHarvested oats go through multiple stages of milling. The first stage is cleaning, to remove seeds of other plants, stones and any other extraneous materials. Next is dehulling to remove the indigestible bran, leaving the seed or \"groat\". Heating denatures enzymes in the seed that would make it go sour or rancid; the grain is then dried to minimise the risk of spoilage by bacteria and fungi. There may follow numerous stages of cutting or grinding the grain, depending on which sort of product is required. For oatmeal (oat flour), the grain is ground to a specified fineness. For home use such as making porridge, oats are often rolled flat to make them quicker to cook.[21] Oat flour can be ground for small scale use by pulsing rolled oats or old-fashioned (not quick) oats in a food processor or spice mill.[22]\n\n### Production And Trade\nIn 2022, global production of oats was 26 million tonnes, led by Canada with 20% of the total and Russia with 17% (table). This compares to over 100 million tonnes for wheat, for example.[23] Global trade represents a modest percentage of production, less than 10%, most of the grain being consumed within producing countries. The main exporter is Canada, followed by Sweden and Finland; the US is the main importer.[24] Oats futures are traded in US dollars in quantities of 5000 bushels on the Chicago Board of Trade and have delivery dates in March, May, July, September, and December.[25]\n\n### Genome\nAvena sativa is an allohexaploid species with three ancestral genomes (2n=6x=42; AACCDD).[26][27][28] As a result, the genome is large (12.6 Gb, 1C-value=12.85) and complex.[29][30] Cultivated hexaploid oat has a unique mosaic chromosome architecture that is the result of numerous translocations between the three subgenomes.[26][31] These translocations may cause breeding barriers and incompatibilities when crossing varieties with different chromosomal architecture. Hence, oat breeding and the crossing of desired traits has been hampered by the lack of a reference genome assembly. In May 2022, a fully annotated reference genome sequence of Avena sativa was reported.[26] The AA subgenome is presumed to be derived from Avena longiglumis and the CCDD from the tetraploid Avena insularis.[26]\n\n### Genetics And Breeding\nSpecies of Avena can hybridize, and genes introgressed (brought in) from other \"A\" genome species have contributed many valuable traits, like resistance to oat crown rust.[32][33] Pc98  is one such trait, introgressed from A. sterilis CAV 1979, conferring all stage resistance (ASR) against Pca.[34] It is possible to hybridize oats with grasses in other genera, allowing plant breeders the ready introgression o",

    "content": "### Description\nSorghum is a large stout grass that grows up to 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) tall. It has large bushy flowerheads or panicles that provide an edible starchy grain with up to 3,000 seeds in each flowerhead. It grows in warm climates worldwide for food and forage.[12][13][14] Sorghum is native to Africa with many cultivated forms.[15][16] Most production uses annual cultivars, but some wild species of Sorghum are perennial; the Land Institute is attempting to develop a perennial cultivar for \"repeated, sufficient grain harvests without resowing.\"[17][18] The name sorghum derives from Italian sorgo, which in turn most likely comes from 12th century Medieval Latin surgum or suricum. This in turn may be from Latin syricum, meaning \"[grass] of Syria\".[19] Types include milo,[20] durra,[21] imphee,[22] hegari,[23] kaffir, feterita, shallu, and kaoliang.[24]\n\n### Phylogeny\nSorghum is closely related to maize and the millets within the PACMAD clade of grasses, and more distantly to the cereals of the BOP clade such as wheat and barley.[25] Bambusoideae (bamboos) (fescue, ryegrass) Hordeum (barley) Triticum (wheat) Secale (rye) Oryza (rice) Pennisetum (fountaingrasses, pearl millet) Millets Sorghum (sorghum) Zea (maize)\n\n### Domestication\nS. bicolor was domesticated from its wild ancestor more than 5,000 years ago in Eastern Sudan in the area of the Rivers Atbara and Gash.[27][28] It has been found at an archaeological site near Kassala in eastern Sudan, dating from 3500 to 3000 BC, and is associated with the Neolithic Butana Group culture.[29] Sorghum bread from graves in Predynastic Egypt, some 5,100 years ago, is displayed in the Egyptian Museum, Turin, Italy.[26] The first race to be domesticated was bicolor; it had tight husks that had to be removed forcibly. Around 4,000 years ago, this spread to the Indian subcontinent; around 3,000 years ago it reached West Africa.[27] Four other races evolved through cultivation to have larger grains and to become free-threshing, making harvests easier and more productive. These were caudatum in the Sahel; durra, most likely in India; guinea in West Africa (later reaching India), and from that race magentiferum that gave rise to the varieties of Southern Africa.[27] Wetter conditions in parts of the Horn of Africa between about 2500 and 1000 years ago supported the expansion of sorghum cultivation and contributed to the development of complex agricultural societies such as Aksum.[30]\n\n### Spread\nIn the Middle Ages, the Arab Agricultural Revolution spread sorghum and other crops from Africa and Asia across the Arab world as far as Al-Andalus in Spain.[31] Sorghum remained the staple food of the medieval kingdom of Alodia and most Sub-Saharan cultures prior to European colonialism.[32] Tall varieties of sorghum with a high sugar content are called sweet sorghum; these are useful for producing a sugar-rich syrup and as forage.[33][34] Sweet sorghum was important to the sugar trade in the 19th century.[35] The price of sugar was rising because of decreased production in the British West Indies and more demand for confectionery and fruit preserves, and the United States was actively searching for a sugar plant that could be produced in northern states. The \"Chinese sugar-cane\", sweet sorghum, was viewed as a plant that would be productive in the West Indies.[36]\n\n### Agronomy\nMost varieties of sorghum are drought- and heat-tolerant, nitrogen-efficient,[37] and are grown particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where the grain is one of the staples for poor and rural people. These varieties provide forage in many tropical regions. S. bicolor is a food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia, and is the fifth most common cereal crop grown in the world.[38][39]  It is usually grown without fertilizers or other inputs by small-holder farmers in developing countries.[40] They benefit from sorghum's ability to compete effectively with weeds, especially when planted in narrow rows. Sorghum actively suppresses weeds by producing sorgoleone, an alkylresorcinol.[41] Sorghum grows in a wide range of temperatures. It can tolerate high altitude and toxic soils, and can recover growth after some drought.[33] Optimum growth temperature range is 12–34 °C (54–93 °F), and the growing season lasts for around 115–140 days.[42] It can grow in a wide range of soils, such as heavy clay to sandy soils with the pH tolerance ranging from 5.0 to 8.5.[43] It requires an arable field that has been left fallow for at least two years or where crop rotation with legumes has taken place in the previous year.[44] Diversified 2- or 4-year crop rotation can improve sorghum yield, making it more resilient to inconsistent growth conditions.[45] Nutrients required by sorghum are comparable to other cereal grain crops with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium needed for growth.[46] The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics has improved sorghum using traditional genetic improvement and integrated genetic and natural resources management practices.[47] Some 194 improved cultivars are planted worldwide.[48] In India, increases in sorghum productivity resulting from improved cultivars have freed up 7 million hectares (17 million acres) of land, enabling farmers to diversify into high-income cash crops and boost their livelihoods.[49] Sorghum is used primarily as poultry feed, and also as cattle feed and in brewing.[50]\n\n### Pests And Diseases\nInsect damage is a major threat to sorghum plants. Over 150 species damage crop plants at different stages of development, resulting in significant biomass loss.[51] Stored sorghum grain is attacked by insect pests such as the lesser grain borer beetle.[52] \nSorghum is a host of the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica, purple witchweed that can reduce production.[53] \nSorghum is subject to a variety of plant pathogens. The fungus Colletotrichum sublineolum causes anthracnose.[54] \nThe toxic ergot fungus attacks the grain, risking harm to humans and livestock.[55] \nSorghum produces chitinases as defensive compounds against fungal diseases. Transgenesis of additional chitinases increases the crop's disease resistance.[56]\n\n### Genetics And Genomics\nThe genome of S. bicolor was sequenced between 2005 and 2007.[57][58] It is generally considered diploid and contains 20 chromosomes,[59] however, there is evidence to suggest a tetraploid origin for S. bicolor.[60] The genome size is approximately 800 Mbp.[61] Paterson et al., 2009 provides a genome assembly of 739 megabase. The most commonly used genome database is SorGSD maintained by Luo et al., 2016. A gene expression atlas is available from Shakoor et al., 2014 with 27,577 genes. For molecular breeding (or other purposes) an SNP array has been created by Bekele et al., 2013, a 3K SNP Infinium from Illumina, Inc.[62] Agrobacterium transformation can be used on sorghum, as shown in a 2018 report of such a transformation system.[63] A 2013 study developed and validated an SNP array for molecular breeding.[62][64]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of sorghum was 57 million tonnes, led by the United States with 14% of the total (table). Mexico, Ethiopia, and India were secondary producers.[65]\n\n### International Trade\nIn 2013, China began purchasing American sorghum as a complementary livestock feed to its domestically grown maize. It imported around $1 billion worth per year until April 2018, when it imposed retaliatory tariffs as part of a trade war.[66] By 2020, the tariffs had been waived, and trade volumes increased [67] before declining again as China began buying sorghum from other countries.[68] As of 2020, China is the world's largest sorghum importer, importing more than all other countries combined.[67] Mexico also accounts for 7% of global sorghum production.[69]\n\n### Nutrition\nThe grain is edible and nutritious. It can be eaten raw when young and milky, but has to be boiled or ground into flour when mature.[72] Sorghum g",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word millet is derived via Old French millet, millot from Latin millium, 'millet', ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mele-, 'to crush'.[6]\n\n### Characteristics\nMillets are small-grained, annual, warm-weather cereals belonging to the grass family. They are highly tolerant of drought and other extreme weather conditions and have a similar nutrient content to other major cereals.[7][8]\n\n### Taxonomic History\nIn 1753, Carl Linnaeus described foxtail millet as Panicum italicum. Finger millet was described as Eleusine coracana by Joseph Gaertner in 1788.[9] In 1812, Palisot de Beauvois grouped several taxa into Setaria italica.[10] The genus Pennisetum was divided by Otto Stapf in 1934 into the section penicillaria, with 32 species including all the cultivated ones, and four other sections. In 1977, J. Brunken and colleagues classed the wild P. violaceum as part of the cultivated species P. glaucum (pearl millet).[10]\n\n### Phylogeny\nThe millets are closely related to sorghum and maize within the PACMAD clade of grasses,[11] and more distantly to the cereals of the BOP clade such as wheat and barley.[12] Bambusoideae (bamboos) Avena (oat), fescue, ryegrass Hordeum (barley) Triticum (wheat) Secale (rye) Oryza (rice) Aristidoideae Panicoideae (most millets; sorghum; maize) Chloridoideae (finger millet; teff) Danthonioideae Arundinoideae Micrairoideae Within the Panicoideae, sorghum (great millet[4]) is in the tribe Andropogoneae, while pearl millet, proso, foxtail, fonio, little millet, sawa, Japanese barnyard millet and kodo are in the tribe Paniceae.[13][14] Within the Chloridoideae, finger millet is in the tribe Cynodonteae, while teff is in the tribe Eragrostideae.[13]\n\n### Taxonomy\nThe different species of millets are not all closely related. All are members of the family Poaceae (the grasses), but they belong to different tribes and subfamilies. Commonly cultivated millets are:[15] Eragrostideae tribe in the subfamily Chloridoideae: Paniceae tribe in the subfamily Panicoideae: Andropogoneae tribe, also in the subfamily Panicoideae:\n\n### Domestication And Spread\nThe cultivation of common millet as the earliest dry crop in East Asia has been attributed to its resistance to drought,[21] and this has been suggested to have aided its spread.[22] Asian varieties of millet made their way from China to the Black Sea region of Europe by 5000 BC.[22] Millet was growing wild in Greece as early as 3000 BC, and bulk storage containers for millet have been found from the Late Bronze Age in Macedonia and northern Greece.[23] Hesiod states that \"the beards grow round the millet, which men sow in summer.\"[24][25] Millet is listed along with wheat in the third century BC by Theophrastus in his Enquiry into Plants.[26]\n\n### East Asia\nProso millet (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica) were important crops beginning in the Early Neolithic of China. Some of the earliest evidence of millet cultivation in China was found at Cishan, where proso millet husk phytoliths and biomolecular components have been identified around 10,300–8,700 years ago in storage pits along with remains of pit-houses, pottery, and stone tools related to millet cultivation.[21] Evidence at Cishan for foxtail millet dates back to around 8,700 years ago.[21] Noodles made from these two varieties of millet were found under a 4,000-year-old earthenware bowl containing well-preserved noodles at the Lajia archaeological site in north China; this is the oldest evidence of millet noodles in China.[27][28] During the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age, a majority of the cereals consumed during the Zhengluo region (modern Henan) of China were foxtail millet and proso millet.[29] Chinese myths attribute the domestication of millet to Shennong, a legendary emperor of China, and Hou Ji, whose name means Lord Millet.[30] Palaeoethnobotanists have found evidence of the cultivation of millet in the Korean Peninsula dating to the Middle Jeulmun pottery period (around 3500–2000 BC).[31][32] Millet continued to be an important element in the intensive, multicropping agriculture of the Mumun pottery period (about 1500–300 BC) in Korea.[32] Millets and their wild ancestors, such as barnyard grass and panic grass, were also cultivated in Japan during the Jōmon period sometime after 4000 BC.[33][31]\n\n### Indian Subcontinent\nLittle millet (Panicum sumatrense) is believed to have been domesticated around 3000 BC in the Indian subcontinent and Kodo millet (Paspalum scrobiculatum) around 3700 BC, also in the Indian subcontinent.[34][35] \nPearl millet had arrived in the Indian subcontinent by 2000 BC to 1700 BC.[36]\nBrowntop millet (Urochloa ramosa) was likely domesticated in the Deccan near the beginning of the third millennium BCE and spread throughout India, though was later superseded by other millets.[19] \nCultivation of Finger millet had spread to South India by 1800 BC.[37] Various millets have been mentioned in some of the Yajurveda texts, identifying foxtail millet (priyaṅgu), Barnyard millet (aṇu) and black finger millet (śyāmāka), indicating that millet cultivation was happening around 1200 BC in India.[38]\n\n### Africa\nFinger millet is native to the highlands of East Africa and was domesticated before the third millennium BC.[37] Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was domesticated in the Sahel region of West Africa from Pennisetum violaceum.[39] Early archaeological evidence in Africa includes finds at Birimi in northern Ghana (1740 cal BC) and Dhar Tichitt in Mauritania (1936–1683 cal BC) and the lower Tilemsi valley in Mali (2500 to 2000 cal BC).[39][36] Studies of isozymes suggest domestication took place north east of the Senegal River in the far west of the Sahel and tentatively around 6000 BC.[39][36]\n\n### Europe\nBroomcorn or proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) came to Europe from East Asia as early as the 17th century BC in Vinogradnyi Sad, Ukraine (modern Mykolaiv Oblast).[40][41] At around 1500 BC it reached Italy and southeastern Europe; around 1400 BC it came to central Europe, and from 1200 BC, it arrived in northern Germany.[42][40]\n\n### Cultivation\nPearl millet is one of the two major dryland crops (alongside sorghum[43]) in the semiarid, impoverished, less fertile agriculture regions of Africa and southeast Asia.[44] Millets are not only adapted to poor, dry infertile soils, but they are also more reliable under these conditions than most other grain crops.[44] Millets, however, do respond to high fertility and moisture. On a per-hectare basis, millet grain production can be 2 to 4 times higher with use of irrigation and soil supplements. Improved varieties of millet with enhanced disease resistance can significantly increase farm yield. There has been cooperation between poor countries to improve millet yields. For example, 'Okashana 1', a variety developed in India from a natural-growing millet variety in Burkina Faso, doubled yields. This variety was selected for trials in Zimbabwe. From there it was taken to Namibia, where it was released in 1990 and enthusiastically adopted by farmers. 'Okashana 1' became the most popular variety in Namibia, the only non-Sahelian country where pearl millet—locally known as mahangu—is the dominant food staple for consumers. 'Okashana 1' was then introduced to Chad. The variety has significantly enhanced yields in Mauritania and Benin.[45] Upon request by the Indian Government in 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations declared 2023 as International Year of Millets.[46]\n\n### Pests And Diseases\nMillets are subject to damage by many insect pests, including corn borers, stemborers, the caterpillars of numerous moths in the families Erebidae and Noctuidae, the millet midge, many species of flies in the Muscidae, as well as Hemipteran bugs of many families including aphids, and species of thrips, beetles, and grasshoppers.[47] Among the many diseases of millets are serious fungal infections such as anthracnose, blas",

    "title": "Rye",
    "content": "### Description\nRye is a tall grass grown for its seeds; it can be an annual or a biennial. Depending on environmental conditions and variety it reaches 1 to 3 metres (3+1⁄2 to 10 ft) in height. Its leaves are blue-green, long, and pointed. The seeds are carried in a curved head or spike some 7 to 15 centimetres (2+3⁄4 to 6 in) long. The head is composed of many spikelets, each of which holds two small flowers; the spikelets alternate left and right up the head.[1] The seeds of rye are some 7 or 8 mm long, much larger and less round than wheat.\n\n### Origins\nThe rye genus Secale is in the grass tribe Triticeae, which contains other cereals such as barley (Hordeum) and wheat (Triticum).[2] The generic name Secale, related to Italian segale and French seigle meaning \"rye\", is of unknown origin but may derive from a Balkan language.[3] The English name rye derives from Old English ryge, related to Dutch rogge, German Roggen, and Russian рожь rožʹ, again all with the same meaning.[4] Rye is one of several cereals that grow wild in the Levant, central and eastern Turkey and adjacent areas. Evidence uncovered at the Epipalaeolithic site of Tell Abu Hureyra in the Euphrates valley of northern Syria suggests that rye was among the first cereal crops to be systematically cultivated, around 13,000 years ago.[5] However, that claim remains controversial; critics point to inconsistencies in the radiocarbon dates, and identifications based solely on grain, rather than on chaff.[6] Domesticated rye occurs in small quantities at a number of Neolithic sites in Asia Minor (Anatolia, now Turkey), such as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B Can Hasan III near Çatalhöyük,[7][8] but is otherwise absent from the archaeological record until the Bronze Age of central Europe, c. 1800–1500 BCE.[9] It is likely that rye was brought westwards from Asia Minor as a secondary crop, meaning that it was a minor admixture in wheat as a result of Vavilovian mimicry, and was only later cultivated in its own right.[10] Archeological evidence of this grain has been found in Roman contexts along the Rhine and the Danube and in Ireland and Britain.[11] The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder was dismissive of a grain that may have been rye, writing that it \"is a very poor food and only serves to avert starvation\".[12] He said it was mixed with emmer \"to mitigate its bitter taste, and even then is most unpleasant to the stomach\".[13]\n\n### Cultivation\nSince the Middle Ages, people have cultivated rye widely in Central and Eastern Europe. It serves as the main bread cereal in most areas east of the France–Germany border and north of Hungary. In Southern Europe, it was cultivated on marginal lands.[14] Rye grows well in much poorer soils than those necessary for most cereal grains. Thus, it is an especially valuable crop in regions where the soil has sand or peat. Rye plants withstand cold better than other small grains, surviving snow cover that would kill winter wheat. Winter rye is the most popular: it is planted and begins to grow in autumn. In spring, the plants develop rapidly.[15] This allows it to provide spring grazing, at a time when spring-planted wheat has only just germinated.[16] The physical properties of rye affect attributes of the final food product such as seed size, surface area, and porosity. The surface area of the seed directly correlates to the drying and heat transfer time.[17] Smaller seeds have increased heat transfer, which leads to lower drying time. Seeds with lower porosity lose water more slowly during the process of drying.[17] Rye is harvested like wheat with a combine harvester, which cuts the plants, threshes and winnows the grain, and releases the straw to the field where it is later pressed into bales or left as soil amendment. The resultant grain is stored in local silos or transported to regional grain elevators and combined with other lots for storage and distant shipment. Before the era of mechanised agriculture, rye harvesting was a manual task performed with scythes or sickles.[18][19]\n\n### Agroecology\nWinter rye is any breed of rye planted in the autumn to provide ground cover for the winter. It grows during warmer days of the winter when sunlight temporarily warms the plant above freezing, even while there is general snow cover. It can be used as a cover crop to prevent the growth of winter-hardy weeds.[20] Rye grows better than any other cereal in heavy clay and light sandy soil, and infertile or drought-affected soils. It can tolerate pH between 4.5 and 8.0, but soils having pH 5.0 to 7.0 are best suited for rye cultivation. Rye grows best in fertile, well-drained loam or clay-loam soils.[21] As for temperature, the crop can thrive in subzero environments, assisted by the production of antifreeze polypeptides (different from those produced by some fish and insects) by the leaves of winter rye.[22] Rye is a common, unwanted invader of winter wheat fields. If allowed to grow and mature, it may cause substantially reduced prices (docking) for harvested wheat.[23]\n\n### Pests And Diseases\nPests including the nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci and a variety of herbivorous insects can seriously affect plant health.[24] Rye is highly susceptible to the ergot fungus.[25][26] Consumption of ergot-infected rye by humans and animals results in ergotism, which causes convulsions, miscarriage, necrosis of digits, hallucinations and death. Historically, damp northern countries that depended on rye as a staple crop were subject to periodic epidemics.[15] Modern grain-cleaning and milling methods have practically eliminated ergotism, but it remains a risk if food safety vigilance breaks down.[27] After an absence of 60 years, stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) has returned to Europe in the 2020s.[28] Areas affected include Germany, Russia (Western Siberia), Spain, and Sweden.[28]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of rye was 12.7 million tonnes, led by Germany with 25% of the total, and Poland and Russia as major secondary producers.\n\n### Health Effects\nRaw rye is 11% water, 76% carbohydrates, 10% protein, and 2% fat. A reference amount of 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) provides 1,410 kilojoules (338 kilocalories) of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber, B vitamins, such as thiamine and niacin (each at 25% DV), and several dietary minerals, including manganese (130% DV), zinc, phosphorus, and magnesium (26–27% DV). According to Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, consuming at least 4 grams (0.14 oz) per day of rye beta-glucan or 0.65 grams (0.023 oz) per serving of soluble fiber can lower levels of blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.[32][33] Eating whole-grain rye, as well as other high-fiber grains, improves regulation of blood sugar (i.e., reduces blood glucose response to a meal).[34] Consuming breakfast cereals containing rye over weeks to months also improved cholesterol levels and glucose regulation.[35]\n\n### Health Concerns\nLike wheat, barley, and their hybrids and derivatives, rye contains glutens and related prolamines, which makes it an unsuitable grain for consumption by people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy, among others.[36] Nevertheless, some wheat allergy patients can tolerate rye or barley.[37]\n\n### Culinary\nRye grain is refined into a flour high in gliadin but low in glutenin and rich in soluble fiber. Alkylresorcinols are phenolic lipids present in high amounts in the bran layer (e.g. pericarp, testa and aleurone layers) of wheat and rye (0.1–0.3% of dry weight).[38] Rye bread, including pumpernickel, is made using rye flour and is a widely eaten food in Northern and Eastern Europe.[39][40] In Scandinavia, rye is widely used to make crispbread (Knäckebröd); in the Middle Ages it was a staple food in the region, and it remains popular in the 21st century.[41] Rye grain is used to make ",

    "content": "### Description\nChenopodium quinoa is a dicotyledonous annual plant, usually about 1–2 m (3–7 ft) high. It has broad, generally powdery, hairy, lobed leaves, normally arranged alternately. The woody central stem is branched or unbranched depending on the variety and may be green, red or purple. The flowering panicles arise from the top of the plant or from leaf axils along the stem. Each panicle has a central axis from which a secondary axis emerges either with flowers (amaranthiform) or bearing a tertiary axis carrying the flowers (glomeruliform).[14] These are small, incomplete, sessile flowers of the same colour as the sepals, and both pistillate and perfect forms occur. Pistillate flowers are generally located at the proximal end of the glomeruli and the perfect ones at the distal end of it. A perfect flower has five sepals, five anthers and a superior ovary, from which two to three stigmatic branches emerge.[15] The green hypogynous flowers have a simple perianth and are generally self-fertilizing,[14][16] though cross-pollination occurs.[17] In the natural environment, betalains serve to attract animals to generate a greater rate of pollination and ensure, or improve, seed dissemination.[18] The fruits (seeds) are about 2 mm (1⁄16 in) in diameter and of various colors — from white to red or black, depending on the cultivar.[19] In regards to the \"newly\" developed salinity resistance of C. quinoa, some studies have concluded that accumulation of organic osmolytes plays a dual role for the species. They provide osmotic adjustment, in addition to protection against oxidative stress of the photosynthetic structures in developing leaves. Studies also suggested that reduction in stomatal density in reaction to salinity levels represents an essential instrument of defence to optimize water use efficiency under the given conditions to which it may be exposed.[20]\n\n### Taxonomy\nThe species Chenopodium quinoa was first described by Carl Ludwig Willdenow (1765–1812),[21] a German botanist who studied plants from South America, brought back by explorers Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland. Quinoa is an allotetraploid plant, containing two full sets of chromosomes from two different species which hybridised with each other at one time. According to a 1979 study, its presumed ancestor is either Chenopodium berlandieri, from North America, or the Andean species Ch. hircinum. On the other hand, morphological features relate Ch. quinoa of the Andes and Ch. nuttalliae of Mexico. More recent studies indicate that Andean and Mexican quinoas were independently domesticated and that both derive from wild North American C. berlandieri, carrying the genome formula AABB, and are likely derived from a hybridization several million years ago between AA and BB diploids closely related to the modern C. subglabrum and C. suecicum, respectively.[22][23] Quinoa's wild South American ancestor, C. hircinum, may have been translocated from North to South America via zoochory. A feral-weedy quinoa, Ch. quinoa var. melanospermum, is known from South America, but no equivalent closely related to Ch. nutalliae has been reported from Mexico so far.[24] Studies regarding the genetic diversity of quinoa suggest that it may have passed through at least three bottleneck genetic events, with a possible fourth expected:\n\n### Etymology\nThe genus name Chenopodium is composed of two words coming from the Greek χήν,-νός, goose and πόδῖον, podion \"little foot\", or \"goose foot\", because of the resemblance of the leaves with the trace of a goose's foot.[26] The specific epithet quinoa is a borrowing from the Spanish quinua or quinoa, itself derived from Quechua kinuwa. The Incas nicknamed quinoa chisiya mama, which in Quechua means \"mother of all grains\".[27]\n\n### Distribution\nChenopodium quinoa is believed to have been domesticated in the Peruvian Andes from wild or weed populations of the same species.[28] There are non-cultivated quinoa plants (Chenopodium quinoa var. melanospermum) that grow in the area it is cultivated; these may either be related to wild predecessors, or they could be descendants of cultivated plants.[29]\n\n### Cultivation\nOver the last 5,000 years the biogeography of Ch. quinoa has changed greatly, mainly by human influence, convenience and preference. It has changed not only in the area of distribution, but also in regards to the climate this plant was originally adapted to, in contrast to the climates on which it is able to successfully grow in now. In a process started by a number of pre-Inca South American indigenous cultures, people in Chile have been adapting quinoa to salinity and other forms of stress over the last 3,000 years.[24] Quinoa is also cultivated, since an early date, near the coast of northern Chile, where it was grown by the Chinchorro culture.[30] Ch. quinoa was brought to the lowlands of south-central Chile at an early date from the Andean highlands.[31][30] Varieties in the lowlands of south-central Chile derive directly from ancestral cultivars which then evolved in parallel to those of the highlands.[31] It has been suggested that the introduction of Ch. quinoa occurred before highland varieties with floury perisperm emerged.[31][30] There are wide discrepancies in the suggested dates of introduction, one study suggests c. 1000 BC as the introduction date while another suggests 600–1100 AD.[30] In colonial times the plant is known to have been cultivated as far south as the Chiloé Archipelago and the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake.[31] The cuisine of Chiloé included bread made of quinoa until at least the mid-19th century.[32] In Chile it had almost disappeared by the early 1940s; as of 2015 the crop is mostly grown in three areas by only some 300 smallholder farmers. Each of these areas is different: indigenous small-scale growers near the border with Bolivia who grow many types of Bolivian forms, a few farmers in the central region who exclusively grow a white-seeded variety and generally market their crops through a well-known cooperative, and in the south by women in home gardens in Mapuche reserves.[24] When Amaranthaceae became abundant in Lake Pacucha, Peru, the lake was fresh, and the lack of Amaranthaceae taxa strongly indicates droughts which turned the lake into a saltmarsh. Based on the pollen associated with soil manipulation, this is an area of the Andes where domestication of C. quinoa became popular, although it was not the only one. It was domesticated in various geographical zones. With this, morphological adaptations began to happen until having five ecotypes today. Quinoa's genetic diversity illustrates that it was and is a vital crop.[33] Andean agronomists and nutrition scientists began researching quinoa in the early twentieth century, and it became the subject of much interest among researchers involved in neglected and underutilized crop studies in the 1970s.[34] In 2004, the international community became increasingly interested in quinoa and it entered a boom and bust economic cycle that would last for over ten years. Between 2004 and 2011, quinoa became a more interesting commodity and global excitement for it increased. At this point, Bolivia and Peru were the only major producers of quinoa. In 2013, there was an extreme increase in imports of quinoa by the United States, Canada and various European countries. In 2016, growth began to slow. Imports were still increasing but at a slower rate and quinoa prices declined as other countries began producing it.[13] By 2015, over 75 countries were producing quinoa, as opposed to only eight countries in the 1980s.[35] Particularly for the high variety of Chilean landraces, in addition to how the plant has adapted to different latitudes, this crop is now potentially cultivable almost anywhere in the world.[24]\n\n### Climate Requirements\nThe plant's growth is highly variable due to the number of different subspecies, varieties and landraces (domesticated plants or animals adap",

    "content": "### Types\nThere are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in antiquity: Hybrid varieties are also cultivated.[7] The two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s. While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white, brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of white cotton have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of colored cotton varieties.\n\n### Etymology\nThe word \"cotton\" has Arabic origins, derived from the Arabic word قطن (qutn or qutun) which is ultimately derived from the Hebrew כֻּתֹּנֶת kuttṓnĕṯ, ironically meaning a clothing made of linen. This was the usual word for cotton in medieval Arabic.[8] Marco Polo in chapter 2 in his book, describes a province he calls Khotan in Turkestan, today's Xinjiang, where cotton was grown in abundance. The word entered the Romance languages in the mid-12th century,[9] and English a century later. Cotton fabric was known to the ancient Romans as an import, but cotton was rare in the Romance-speaking lands until imports from the Arabic-speaking lands in the later medieval era at transformatively lowered prices.[10][11]\n\n### Early History\nThe presence of the indigenous species Gossypium barbadense has been identified at a site in Nanchoc District, Peru, and dated to the 7th–6th millennia BC, while indigo blue dyed textile fragments, dated to the 4th–3rd millennia BC, having been found at Huaca Prieta, Peru.[3] Cultivation of the indigenous cotton species G. barbadense from a find in Ancon, Peru has been dated to c. 4200 BC,[12] and was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures such as the Norte Chico, Moche, and Nazca. Cotton was grown upriver, made into nets, and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large supplies of fish. The Spanish who came to Mexico and Peru in the early 16th century found the people growing cotton and wearing clothing made of it. Cotton bolls from in a cave near Tehuacán, Mexico, have been dated to as early as 5500 BC.[13] The domestication of Gossypium hirsutum, in Mexico, is dated to between around 3400 and 2300 BC.[14] During this time, people between the Río Santiago and the Río Balsas grew, spun, wove, dyed, and sewed cotton. What they did not use themselves, they sent to their Aztec rulers as tribute, on the scale of ~116 million pounds (53,000 tonnes) annually.[15] The earliest evidence of the use of cotton in the Old World, in the form of a few fibres of mineralised cotton thread, was found in a string of eight copper beads at the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh, at the foot of the Bolan Pass, Balochistan, Pakistan.[16][17][18]  Fragments of cotton textiles and spindle whorls, dated to the 3rd millennia BC, have also been found at Mohenjo-daro, in Sindh, Pakistan, and other sites of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, which is a likely site for the first cultivation of Gossypium arboreum,[19] and cotton may have been an important export from it.[20] Microremains of cotton fibers, some dyed, have been found at Tel Tsaf in the Jordan Valley dated 5,200 BCE. They may be the remnants of ancient clothing, fabric containers, or cordage. Research suggest the cotton might come from wild species in South Asia, and traded with the Indus Valley Civilisation.[19] In Iran (Persia), the history of cotton dates back to the Achaemenid era (5th century BC); however, there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre-Islamic Iran. Cotton cultivation was common in Merv, Ray and Pars. In Persian poems, especially Ferdowsi's Shahname, there are references to cotton (\"panbe\" in Persian). Marco Polo (13th century) refers to the major products of Persia, including cotton. John Chardin, a French traveler of the 17th century who visited Safavid Persia, spoke approvingly of the vast cotton farms of Persia.[21] The Greeks and the Arabs were not familiar with cotton until the wars of Alexander the Great, as his contemporary Megasthenes told Seleucus I Nicator of \"there being trees on which wool grows\" in \"Indica\".[22] This may be a reference to \"tree cotton\", Gossypium arboreum, which is native to the Indian subcontinent. According to the Columbia Encyclopedia:[23] Cotton has been spun, woven, and dyed since prehistoric times. It clothed the people of ancient India, Egypt, and China. Hundreds of years before the Christian era, cotton textiles were woven in India with matchless skill, and their use spread to the Mediterranean countries. Cotton (Gossypium herbaceum Linnaeus) may have been domesticated 5000 BC in eastern Sudan near the Middle Nile Basin region, where cotton cloth was being produced.[24] Around the 4th century BC, the cultivation of cotton and the knowledge of its spinning and weaving in Meroë reached a high level. The export of textiles was one of the sources of wealth for Meroë. Ancient Nubia had a \"culture of cotton\" of sorts, evidenced by physical evidence of cotton processing tools and the presence of cattle in certain areas. Some researchers propose that cotton was important to the Nubian economy for its use in contact with the neighboring Egyptians.[25] Aksumite King Ezana boasted in his inscription that he destroyed large cotton plantations in Meroë during his conquest of the region.[26] In the Meroitic Period (beginning 3rd century BCE), many cotton textiles have been recovered, preserved due to favorable arid conditions.[25] Most of these fabric fragments come from Lower Nubia, and the cotton textiles account for 85% of the archaeological textiles from Classic/Late Meroitic sites.[27] Due to these arid conditions, cotton, a plant that usually thrives moderate rainfall and richer soils, requires extra irrigation and labor in Sudanese climate conditions. Therefore, a great deal of resources would have been required, likely restricting its cultivation to the elite.[27] In the first to third centuries CE, recovered cotton fragments all began to mirror the same style and production method, as seen from the direction of spun cotton and technique of weaving.[27] Cotton textiles also appear in places of high regard, such as on funerary stelae and statues.[27] During the Han dynasty (207 BC - 220 AD), cotton was grown by Chinese peoples in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan.[28]\n\n### Middle Ages\nEgyptians grew and spun cotton in the first seven centuries of the Christian era.[29] Handheld roller cotton gins had been used in India since the 6th century, and was then introduced to other countries from there.[30] Between the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water power.[31] The earliest clear illustrations of the spinning wheel come from the Islamic world in the eleventh century.[32] The earliest unambiguous reference to a spinning wheel in India is dated to 1350, suggesting that the spinning wheel was likely introduced from Iran to India during the Delhi Sultanate.[33] During the late medieval period, cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern Europe, without any knowledge of how it was derived, other than that it was a plant. Because Herodotus had written in his Histories, Book III, 106, that in India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German Baumwolle, which translates as \"tree wool\" (Baum means \"tree\"; Wolle means \"wool\"). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. John Mandeville, writing in 1350, stated as fact that \"There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that th",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe term sugarcane is a combination of two words: \"sugar\" and \"cane\". The former ultimately derives from Sanskrit शर्करा (śárkarā). As sugar was traded and spread West, this became سُكَّر (sukkar) in Arabic, saccharum or succarum in Latin, zucchero in Italian, and eventually sucre in both Middle French and Middle English. The second term \"cane\" began to be used alongside it as the crop was grown on plantations in the Caribbean. [citation needed]\n\n### Characteristics\nSugarcane, a perennial tropical grass,[11] exhibits a unique growth pattern characterized by lateral shoots emerging at its base, leading to the development of multiple stems. These stems typically attain a height of 3 to 4 meters (approximately 10 to 13 feet) and possess a diameter of about 5 centimeters (approximately 2 inches). As these stems mature, they evolve into cane stalks, constituting a substantial portion of the entire plant, accounting for roughly 75% of its composition.[citation needed] A fully mature cane stalk generally comprises a composition of around 11–16% fiber, 12–16% soluble sugars, 2–3% non-sugar carbohydrates, and 63–73% water content. The successful cultivation of sugarcane hinges on a delicate interplay of several factors, including climatic conditions, soil properties, the selection of specific varieties, and the timing of the harvest.[citation needed] In terms of yield, the average production of cane stalk stands at 60–70 tonnes per hectare (equivalent to 24–28 long tons per acre or 27–31 short tons per acre) annually. However, this yield figure is not fixed and can vary significantly, ranging from 30 to 180 tonnes per hectare. This variance is contingent upon the level of knowledge applied and the approach to crop management embraced in the cultivation of sugarcane. Ultimately, the successful cultivation of this valuable crop demands a thoughtful integration of various factors to optimize its growth and productivity.[citation needed] Sugarcane is a cash crop, but it is also used as livestock fodder.[12] Sugarcane genome is one of the most complex plant genomes known, mostly due to interspecific hybridization and polyploidization.[13][14]\n\n### History\nThe two centers of domestication for sugarcane are one for Saccharum officinarum by Papuans in New Guinea and another for Saccharum sinense by Austronesians in Taiwan and southern China. Papuans and Austronesians originally primarily used sugarcane as food for domesticated pigs. The spread of both S. officinarum and S. sinense is closely linked to the migrations of the Austronesian peoples. Saccharum barberi was only cultivated in India after the introduction of S. officinarum.[15][16] S. officinarum was first domesticated in New Guinea and the islands east of the Wallace Line by Papuans, where it is the modern center of diversity. Beginning around 6,000 BP, several strains were selectively bred from the native Saccharum robustum. From New Guinea, it spread westwards to Maritime Southeast Asia after contact with Austronesians, where it hybridized with Saccharum spontaneum.[16] The second domestication center is southern China and Taiwan, where S. sinense was a primary cultigen of the Austronesian peoples. Words for sugarcane are reconstructed as *təbuS or *CebuS in Proto-Austronesian, which became *tebuh in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian. It was one of the original major crops of the Austronesian peoples from at least 5,500 BP. Introduction of the sweeter S. officinarum may have gradually replaced it throughout its cultivated range in maritime Southeast Asia.[18][19][17][20][21] From Insular Southeast Asia, S. officinarum was spread eastward into Polynesia and Micronesia by Austronesian voyagers as a canoe plant by around 3,500 BP. It was also spread westward and northward by around 3,000 BP to China and India by Austronesian traders, where it further hybridized with S. sinense and S. barberi. From there, it spread further into western Eurasia and the Mediterranean.[16][17] The earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern India.   The earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts.[23][24][25][26] Around the eighth century, Muslim and Arab traders introduced sugar from medieval India to the other parts of the Abbasid Caliphate in the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, Egypt, North Africa, and Andalusia. By the 10th century, sources state that every village in Mesopotamia grew sugarcane.[22] It was among the early crops brought to the Americas by the Spanish, mainly Andalusians, from their fields in the Canary Islands, and the Portuguese from their fields in the Madeira Islands. An article on sugarcane cultivation in Spain is included in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century Book on Agriculture.[27] The first chemically refined sugar appeared on the scene in India about 2,500 years ago. From there, the technique spread east towards China, and west towards Persia and the early Islamic worlds, eventually reaching the Mediterranean in the 13th century. Cyprus and Sicily became important centers for sugar production. In colonial times, sugar formed one side of the triangle trade of New World raw materials, along with European manufactured goods, and African slaves. Christopher Columbus first brought sugarcane to the Caribbean (and the New World) during his second voyage to the Americas, initially to the island of Hispaniola (modern day Haiti and the Dominican Republic). The first sugar harvest happened in Hispaniola in 1501; many sugar mills were constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s.[28] The Portuguese introduced sugarcane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Suriname.[citation needed] Sugar, often in the form of molasses, was shipped from the Caribbean to Europe or New England, where it was used to make rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were then used to purchase manufactured goods, which were then shipped to West Africa, where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar, which was shipped to Europe. Toil in the sugar plantations became a main basis for the Atlantic slave trade, supplying people to work under brutal coercion.[citation needed] The passage of the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act led to the abolition of slavery through most of the British Empire, and many of the emancipated slaves no longer worked on sugarcane plantations when they had a choice. West Indian planters, therefore, needed new workers, and they found cheap labour in China and India.[29][30] The people were subject to indenture, a long-established form of contract, which bound them to unfree labour for a fixed term. The conditions where the indentured servants worked were frequently abysmal, owing to a lack of care among the planters.[31] The first ships carrying indentured labourers from India left in 1836.[32] The migrations to serve sugarcane plantations led to a significant number of ethnic Indians, Southeast Asians, and Chinese people settling in various parts of the world.[33] In some islands and countries, the South Asian migrants now constitute between 10 and 50% of the population. Sugarcane plantations and Asian ethnic groups continue to thrive in countries such as Fiji, South Africa, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad, Martinique, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, St. Kitts, St. Croix, Suriname, Nevis, and Mauritius.[32][34] Between 1863 and 1900, merchants and plantation owners in Queensland and New South Wales (now part of the Commonwealth of Australia) brought between 55,000 and 62,500 people from the South Pacific islands to work on sugarcane plantations. An estimated one-third of these workers were coerced or kidnapped into slavery (known as blackbirding); many ",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe English word tobacco originates from the Spanish word tabaco.[4] The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived, at least in part, from Taíno, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taíno, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552), or to tabago, a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo, with the leaves themselves being referred to as cohiba).[5][4] However, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 for certain medicinal herbs. These probably derived from the Arabic طُبّاق ṭubbāq (also طُباق ṭubāq), a word reportedly dating to the ninth century, referring to various herbs.[6][7]\n\n### Cultural Significance\nAccording to Haudenosaunee mythology, tobacco first grew out of Earth Woman's head after she died giving birth to her twin sons, Sapling and Flint.[8]\n\n### Traditional Use\nTobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BCE.[9] Many Native American tribes traditionally grow and use tobacco.[10] Historically, people from the Northeast Woodlands cultures have carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item. It was smoked both socially and ceremonially, such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement.[11][12] In some Native cultures, tobacco is seen as a gift from the Creator, with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.[13] Some Native Americans consider tobacco to be a medicine and advocate for its respectful usage, rather than a commercial one.[14]\n\n### Popularization\nFollowing the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. In 1559, Francisco Hernández de Toledo, Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the Old World, following orders of King Philip II of Spain. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of Toledo, more specifically in an area known as \"Los Cigarrales\" named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (cigarras in Spanish). Before the development of the lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the midwakh or kiseru, or newly invented waterpipes such as the bong or the hookah (see thuốc lào for a modern continuance of this practice). Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin.[15] While a lucrative product, the growing expansion of tobacco demand was intimately tied to the history of slavery in the Caribbean.[16] The alleged benefits of tobacco also contributed to its success. The astronomer Thomas Harriot, who accompanied Sir Richard Grenville on his 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island, thought that the plant \"openeth all the pores and passages of the body\" so that the bodies of the natives \"are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithal we in England are often times afflicted.\"[17] Production of tobacco for smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.[18][19] Tobacco has been a major cash crop in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.[20] Cigarettes became increasingly popular in the late 19th century when James Bonsack invented a machine to automate cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the tobacco industry until the health revelations of the 20th century.[21][22]\n\n### Contemporary\nFollowing the scientific revelations of the early-to-mid-20th century, tobacco was condemned as a health hazard and eventually became recognized as a cause of cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the adoption of the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled the many lawsuits by the U.S. states in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.[23] In the 1970s, Brown & Williamson crossbred tobacco to produce Y1, a strain containing an unusually high nicotine content, nearly doubling from 3.2–3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to allege that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.[24] The desire of many addicted smokers to quit has led to the development of tobacco cessation products.[25] In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization[26] successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco.[27] Between 2019 and 2021, concerns about increased COVID-19 health risks due to tobacco consumption facilitated smoking reduction and cessation.[28]\n\n### Nicotiana\nMany species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs Nicotiana. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) indigenous to North and South America, Australia, south west Africa, and the South Pacific.[29] Most nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. However, tobacco contains a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals. Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores,[30] a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. For example, although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest, tobacco's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival.[31] As a result, some tobacco plants (chiefly N. glauca) have become established as invasive weeds in some places.\n\n### Types\nThe types of tobacco include:\n\n### Parasites\nTobacco, alongside its related products, can be infested by parasites such as Lasioderma serricorne (the tobacco beetle) and Ephestia elutella (the tobacco moth), which are the most widespread and damaging parasites to the tobacco industry.[32] Infestation can range from the tobacco cultivated in the fields to the tobacco leaves used for manufacturing cigars, cigarillos, cigarettes, etc.[32] Both the larvae of Lasioderma serricorne and caterpillars of Ephestia elutella are considered major pests.[32]\n\n### Cultivation\nTobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris or E. pubescens), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Modern tobacco seeds are sown in cold frames or hotbeds, as their germination is activated by light.[33] In the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite, which partially starves the plant of nitrogen, to produce a more desired flavor. After the plants are about 8 inches (20 cm)  tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant.[34] A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mec",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word coffee entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve (قهوه), borrowed in turn from the Arabic qahwah (قَهْوَة).[9] Medieval Arabic lexicons traditionally held that the etymology of qahwah meant 'wine', given its distinctly dark color, and was derived from the verb qahiya (قَهِيَ), 'to have no appetite'.[10] The word qahwah most likely meant 'the dark one', referring to the brew or the bean; qahwah is not the name of the bean, which are known in Arabic as bunn and in Cushitic languages as būn. Semitic languages have the root qhh, 'dark color', which became a natural designation for the beverage. Its cognates include the Hebrew qehe(h) 'dulling' and the Aramaic qahey ('give acrid taste to').[10] Although etymologists have connected it with a word meaning 'wine', it is also thought to be from the Kaffa region of Ethiopia.[11] The terms coffee pot and coffee break originated in 1705 and 1952, respectively.[12]\n\n### Historical Transmission\nThe earliest possible references to the coffee bean and its qualities appear in al-Razi's 10th-century al-Hawi[a] and in Ibn Sina's 11th-century Qanun[13][b] both which describe a coffee plant component called Latin: bunchum as hot and dry[c]—with al-Razi reporting beneficial effects for the stomach and Ibn Sina also adding claims for the skin and body odor. According to later accounts, bunchum was made from a root rather than from coffee beans.[14][15] There is no confirmed evidence, either historical or archaeological, of coffee as a drink being consumed before the 15th century. The beverage appears to be a relatively recent development. By the late 15th century, coffee drinking was well established among Sufi communities in Yemen.[14][16] One of the most important of the early writers on coffee was Abd al-Qadir al-Jaziri, who in 1587 compiled a work tracing the history and legal controversies of coffee entitled Umdat al Safwa fi hill al-qahwa in which he claims that the coffee bean originated in the \"land of Sa'ad ad-Din, and the country of Abyssinia, and of the Jabart, and other places of the land of ‘Ajam, but the time of its first use is unknown, nor do we know the reason.\" Al-Jazīrī asserts that coffee was introduced to Cairo at the start of the 16th century by Sufi devotees.[17] The 16th century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami writes about the plant's development from a tree in the Zeila region.[18] In 1542, a Portuguese crew met with a ship from Zeila transporting clarified butter and coffee to Al-Shihr in Yemen.[19] The use of coffee is believed to have spread across the Red Sea to the Rasulid sultanate of Yemen, who maintained cultural and commercial ties with the Adal Sultanate. Its consumption first appears in Yemen, particularly in regions such as Aden, Mocha and Zabid during the 15th century.[20][21] Because of coffee's association with Muslims, the Christian Ethiopian Empire avoided it until the end of the 19th century.[22] Other sources of coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen,[4] where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals.[23] Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant before its appearance in Yemen. Coffee may have been introduced to Yemen from Ethiopia via trade across the Red Sea.[24] One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd al-Dhabḥani for bringing coffee to Aden from the Somali coast,[25] other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia.[25][26][23] By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa.[27] The first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India during the time. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilized. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore. In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee after returning from a ten-year trip to the Near East: A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses, particularly those of the stomach. Its consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly, in a porcelain cup passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu. — Léonard Rauwolf, Reise in die Morgenländer (in German) Within the Ottoman Empire, the first coffeehouse opened in 1555 in Tahtakale, Istanbul.[28] Since Tahtakale is to the West of the Bosporus strait, this would likely have been the first coffee house in Europe. Thriving trade brought many goods, including coffee, from the Ottoman Empire to Venice. Coffee became more widely accepted in Europe after it was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the \"Muslim drink\". Coffee had spread to Italy by 1600 and then to the rest of Europe, Indonesia, and the Americas.[29] The first European coffeehouse outside of the Ottoman Empire opened in Venice in 1647.[30]\n\n### As A Colonial Import\nThe Dutch East India Company was the first to import coffee on a large scale.[1] The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon.[31] The first exports of Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711.[32] Through the efforts of the British East India Company, coffee became popular in England. In a diary entry of May 1637, John Evelyn records tasting the drink at Oxford, where it had been brought by a student of Balliol College from Crete named Nathaniel Conopios of Crete.[33][34] Oxford's Queen's Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is still in existence today. Coffee was introduced in France in 1657 and in Austria and Poland after the 1683 Battle of Vienna, when coffee was captured from supplies of the defeated Turks.[35] When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as in Europe, as alcoholic beverages remained more popular. During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically; this was also due to the reduced availability of tea from British merchants,[36] and a general resolution among many Americans to avoid drinking tea following the 1773 Boston Tea Party.[37] During the 18th century, coffee consumption declined in Britain, giving way to tea drinking. Tea was simpler to make and had become cheaper with the British conquest of India and the tea industry there.[38] During the Age of Sail, seamen aboard ships of the British Royal Navy made substitute coffee by dissolving burnt bread in hot water.[39] According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839–1854), Mokha historically imported up to two-thirds of its coffee from Berbera-based merchants before the coffee trade of Mokha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. After that, much of the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.[40] Frenchman Gabriel de Clieu took a coffee plant to the French territory of Martinique in the Caribbean in the 1720s,[41] from which much of the world's cultivated arabica coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed across the Americas.[42] Coffee was cultivated in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) from 1734, and by 1788 it had supplied half the world's coffee.[43] The conditions that the enslaved people worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the Haitian Revolution, and the coffee industry never fully recovered there.[44]\n\n### Mass Production\nIn the late 16th century, Yemen developed a booming coffee economy.

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe etymology of the various words for tea reflects the history of transmission of tea drinking and trade from China.[15] Nearly all of the words for tea worldwide fall into three broad groups: te, cha and chai, present in English as tea, cha or char, and chai. The earliest of the three to enter English is cha, which came in the 1590s via the Portuguese, who traded in Macao and picked up the Cantonese pronunciation of the word.[16][17] The more common tea form arrived in the 17th century via the Dutch, who acquired it either indirectly from the Malay teh, or directly from the tê pronunciation in Min Chinese.[16] The third form chai (meaning \"spiced tea\") originated from a northern Chinese pronunciation of cha, which travelled overland to Central Asia and Persia where it picked up a Persian ending yi. The Chinese word for tea itself was perhaps derived from the non-Sinitic languages of the botanical homeland of the tea plant in south-west China (or Burma), possibly from an archaic Austro-Asiatic root word *la, meaning \"leaf\".[18]\n\n### Botanical Origin\nTea plants are native to East Asia and the probable center of origin of tea is near the source of the Irrawaddy River from where it spread out fan-wise into southeast China, Indo-China and Assam. The natural home of the tea plant is considered to be within the comparatively small fan-shaped area between Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram along the Burma frontier in the west, through China as far as the Zhejiang Province in the east, and from this line generally south through the hills to Burma and Thailand to Vietnam. The west–east axis indicated above is about 2,400 km long extending from longitude 95°-120°E. The north–south axis covers about 1,920 km, starting from the northern part of Burma, latitude 29°N passing through Yunnan, Tongkin, Thailand, Laos and on to Annan, reaching latitude 11°N.[19] Chinese (small-leaf) type tea (C. sinensis var. sinensis) may have originated in southern China possibly with hybridization of unknown wild tea relatives. Since there are no known wild populations of this tea, its origin is speculative.[20][21] Given their genetic differences forming distinct clades, Chinese Assam-type tea (C. sinensis var. assamica) may have two parentages – one being found in southern Yunnan (Xishuangbanna, Pu'er City) and the other in western Yunnan (Lincang, Baoshan). Many types of Southern Yunnan Assam tea have been hybridized with the closely related species Camellia taliensis. Unlike Southern Yunnan Assam tea, Western Yunnan Assam tea shares many genetic similarities with Indian Assam-type tea (also C. sinensis var. assamica). Thus, Western Yunnan Assam tea and Indian Assam tea both may have originated from the same parent plant in the area where southwestern China, Indo-Burma, and Tibet meet. However, as the Indian Assam tea shares no haplotypes with Western Yunnan Assam tea, Indian Assam tea is likely to have originated from an independent domestication. Some Indian Assam tea appears to have hybridized with the species Camellia pubicosta.[20][21] Assuming a generation of 12 years, Chinese small-leaf tea is estimated to have diverged from Assam tea around 22,000 years ago, while Chinese Assam tea and Indian Assam tea diverged 2,800 years ago. The divergence of Chinese small-leaf tea and Assam tea would correspond to the last glacial maximum.[20][21]\n\n### Early Tea Drinking\nPeople in ancient East Asia ate tea for centuries, perhaps even millennia, before ever consuming it as a beverage. They would nibble on the leaves raw, add them to soups or greens, or ferment them and chew them as areca nut is chewed.[23] Tea drinking may have begun in the region of Yunnan, where it was used for medicinal purposes. It is believed that in Sichuan, \"people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal concoction.\"[5] Chinese legends attribute the invention of tea to the mythical Shennong (in central and northern China) in 2737 BC, although evidence suggests that tea drinking may have been introduced from southwest China.[22] The earliest written records of tea come from China. The word tú 荼 appears in the Shijing and other ancient texts to signify a kind of \"bitter vegetable\" (苦菜), and it is possible that it referred to many different plants such as sow thistle, chicory, or smartweed,[24] as well as tea.[25] In the Chronicles of Huayang, it was recorded that the Ba people in Sichuan presented tu to the Zhou king. The Qin later conquered the state of Ba and its neighbour Shu, and according to the 17th century scholar Gu Yanwu who wrote in Ri Zhi Lu (日知錄): \"It was after the Qin had taken Shu that they learned how to drink tea.\"[2] Another possible early reference to tea is found in a letter written by the Qin dynasty general Liu Kun who requested that some \"real tea\" to be sent to him.[26] The earliest known physical evidence[27] of tea was discovered in 2016 in the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han in Xi'an, indicating that tea from the genus Camellia was drunk by Han dynasty emperors as early as the second century BC.[28] The Han dynasty work \"The Contract for a Youth\", written by Wang Bao in 59 BC,[29] contains the first known reference to boiling tea. Among the tasks listed to be undertaken by the youth, the contract states that \"he shall boil tea and fill the utensils\" and \"he shall buy tea at Wuyang\".[2] The first record of tea cultivation is dated to this period, during which tea was cultivated on Meng Mountain (蒙山) near Chengdu.[30] Another early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text by the Chinese physician Hua Tuo, who stated, \"to drink bitter t'u constantly makes one think better.\"[31] However, before the Tang dynasty, tea-drinking was primarily a southern Chinese practice centered in Jiankang.[32] Tea was disdained by the Northern dynasties aristocrats, who describe it as inferior to yogurt.[33][34] It became widely popular during the Tang dynasty, when it spread to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. The Classic of Tea, a treatise on tea and its preparations, was written by the 8th century Chinese writer, Lu Yu. The current Chinese word for tea (茶) appeared in The Classic of Tea by removing a stroke from the word tu.[35]  Lu was known to have influenced tea drinking on a large part in China.[36]\n\n### Developments\nThrough the centuries, a variety of techniques for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Han and Six Dynasties, tea was steamed and pounded, shaped into cake form, slowly dried over low fire, and suspended to air dry. Chunks of tea were then boiled to drink, flavoured with orange peels, jujube, mint, ginger or scallion.[37] Tea was similarly prepared in cake form during the Tang dynasty, but the technique slowly changed.[38] By the Song dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first stirred in a hot dry pan, then rolled and air-dried, a process that stops the oxidation process that would have turned the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the leaves are allowed to partially oxidize before being heated in the pan, was developed.[32] Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently careless practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, which yielded a different flavour.[39]\n\n### Worldwide Spread\nTea was first introduced to Western priests and merchants in China during the 16th century, at which time it was termed chá.[14] The earliest European reference to tea, written as chiai, came from Delle navigationi e viaggi written by Venetian Giambattista ",

    "content": "### Amazonian Rubber Tree (Hevea Brasiliensis)\nThe major commercial source of natural rubber latex is the Amazonian rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis),[1] a member of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. Once native to Brazil, the species is now pan-tropical. This species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years.[7]\n\n### Congo Rubber (Landolphia Owariensis And L. Spp.)\nCongo rubber, formerly a major source of rubber, which motivated the atrocities in the Congo Free State, came from vines in the genus Landolphia (L. kirkii, L. heudelotis, and L. owariensis).[8]\n\n### Dandelion\nDandelion milk contains latex. The latex exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from rubber trees. In the wild types of dandelion, latex content is low and varies greatly. In Nazi Germany, research projects tried to use dandelions as a base for rubber production, but failed.[9] In 2013, by inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Germany developed a cultivar of the Kazakh dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz) that seems suitable for commercial production of natural rubber. In collaboration with Continental Tires, IME began a pilot facility.\n\n### Other\nMany other plants produce forms of latex rich in isoprene polymers, though not all produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará.[10] Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most are more difficult to tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (Palaquium gutta)[11] and chicle from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama rubber tree (Castilla elastica), Micrandra minor (source of Caurá rubber),[12] various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Kazakh dandelion, and, perhaps most important (for its hypoallergenic properties), guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.[13]\n\n### History\nThe first use of rubber was by the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica. The earliest archeological evidence of the use of natural latex from the Hevea tree comes from the Olmec culture, in which rubber was first used for making balls for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Rubber was later used by the Maya and Aztec cultures: in addition to making balls, Aztecs used rubber for other purposes, such as making containers and making textiles waterproof by impregnating them with the latex sap.[14][15] Charles Marie de La Condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the Académie Royale des Sciences of France in 1736, which he wrote as caoutchouc, from cahuchu in the language of the Manina people in Quito.[16][17] In 1751, he presented a paper by François Fresneau to the Académie (published in 1755) that described many of rubber's properties. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber.[17] In England, Joseph Priestley, in 1770, observed that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing off pencil marks on paper, hence the name \"rubber\".[16] It slowly made its way around England. In 1764, François Fresnau discovered that turpentine was a rubber solvent. Giovanni Fabbroni is credited with the discovery of naphtha as a rubber solvent in 1779.[18][19] Charles Goodyear redeveloped vulcanization in 1839, although Mesoamericans had used stabilized rubber for balls and other objects as early as 1600 BC.[20][21] South America remained the main source of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The rubber trade was heavily controlled by business interests but no laws expressly prohibited the export of seeds or plants. In 1876, Henry Wickham smuggled 70,000 Amazonian rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to Kew Gardens, England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to India, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), Singapore, and British Malaya. Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber.[22] In the early 1900s, the Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced labor.[23] King Leopold II's colonial state brutally enforced production quotas due to the high price of natural rubber at the time.[24] Tactics to enforce the rubber quotas included removing the hands of victims to prove they had been killed. Soldiers often came back from raids with baskets full of chopped-off hands. Villages that resisted were razed to encourage better compliance locally.[24][25] (See Atrocities in the Congo Free State for more information on the rubber trade in the Congo Free State in the late 1800s and early 1900s.) The rubber boom in the Amazon also similarly affected indigenous populations to varying degrees. Correrias, or slave raids were frequent in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia where many were either captured or killed. The best-known case of atrocities generated from rubber extraction in South America came from the Putumayo genocide. Between the 1880s and 1913, Julio César Arana and his company, which would become the Peruvian Amazon Company, controlled the Putumayo river. W. E. Hardenburg, Benjamin Saldaña Rocca and Roger Casement were influential figures in exposing these atrocities. Roger Casement was also prominent in revealing the Congo atrocities to the world. Days before entering Iquitos by boat Casement wrote \"'Caoutchouc was first called 'india rubber,' because it came from the Indies, and the earliest European use of it was to rub out or erase. It is now called India rubber because it rubs out or erases the Indians.\"[26][27] In India, commercial cultivation was introduced by British planters, although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale were initiated as early as 1873 at the Calcutta Botanical Garden. The first commercial Hevea plantations were established at Thattekadu in Kerala in 1902. In later years the plantation expanded to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. Today, India is the world's third-largest producer and fourth-largest consumer of rubber.[28] In Singapore and Malaya, commercial production was heavily promoted by Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley, who served as the first Scientific Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens from 1888 to 1911. He distributed rubber seeds to many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex without causing serious harm to the tree.[29] Because of his fervent promotion of this crop, he is popularly remembered by the nickname \"Mad Ridley\".[30]\n\n### Pre–World War Ii\nBefore World War II significant uses included door and window profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, matting, flooring, and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the automotive industry. The use of rubber in car tires (initially solid rather than pneumatic) in particular consumed a significant amount of rubber. Gloves (medical, household, and industrial) and toy balloons were large consumers of rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant tonnage of rubber was used as adhesives in many manufacturing industries and products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet industries. Rubber was commonly used to make rubber bands and pencil erasers. Rubber produced as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had significant value to the textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either a",

    "content": "### Cultivation\nThe jute plant needs plain alluvial soil and standing water. During the monsoon season, the monsoon climate offers a warm and wet environment which is suitable for growing jute. Temperatures from 20 to 40 °C (68 to 104 °F) and relative humidity of 70%–80% are favorable for successful cultivation. Jute requires 5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) of rainfall weekly, and more during the sowing time. Soft water is necessary for jute production.\n\n### White Jute (Corchorus Capsularis)\nHistorical documents (including Ain-e-Akbari by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak in 1590) state that the poor villagers in India once wore clothing made of jute. The weavers used simple hand-spinning wheels and handlooms, which were also employed to spin cotton yarns. Historical evidence further suggests that Indians—especially Bengalis—used ropes and twines made of white jute since ancient times for household and other purposes. Jute has long been valued for carrying grains and other agricultural products.\n\n### Tossa Jute (Corchorus Olitorius)\nTossa jute (Corchorus olitorius) is a variety thought to be native to South Asia. It is grown for both fiber and culinary purposes. People use the leaves as an ingredient in a mucilaginous potherb called \"molokhiya\" (ملوخية, of uncertain etymology), which is mainly used in some Arabic countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and Syria as a soup-based dish, sometimes with meat over rice or lentils. The King James translation of the Book of Job (chapter 30, verse 4), in the Hebrew Bible, mistranslates the word מלוח maluaḥ, which means Atriplex as \"mallow\", which in turn has led some to identify this jute species as that what was meant by the translators, and led it to be called 'Jew's mallow' in English.[5] It is high in protein, vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, and iron. Bangladesh and other countries in Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific mainly use jute for its fiber. Tossa jute fiber is softer, silkier, and stronger than white jute. This variety shows good sustainability in the Ganges Delta climate. Along with white jute, tossa jute has also been cultivated in the soil of Bengal where has been known as paat since the start of the 19th century. Coremantel, Bangladesh, is the largest global producer of the tossa jute variety. In India, West Bengal is the largest producer of jute.\n\n### History\nJute has been used for making textiles in the Indus valley civilization since the 3rd millennium BC.[6] For centuries, jute has been a part of the culture of Bangladesh and some parts of West Bengal and Assam. The British started trading in jute during the seventeenth century. During the reign of the British Empire, jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich by processing jute and selling manufactured products made from it. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal, and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches of World War I, and to the American South for bagging cotton. It was used in multiple industries, including the fishing, construction, art, and arms industries. Due to its coarse and tough texture, jute could initially only be processed by hand, until someone in Dundee discovered that treating it with whale oil made it machine processable.[7] The industry boomed throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (\"jute weaver\" was a recognized trade occupation in the 1901 UK census), but this trade largely ceased by about 1970, being substituted for by synthetic fibres. In the 21st century, jute has become a large export again, mainly in Bangladesh.\n\n### Production\nThe jute fiber comes from the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The fibers are first extracted by retting, a process in which jute stems are bundled together and immersed in slow running water. There are two types of retting: stem and ribbon.[clarification needed] After the retting process, stripping begins. In the stripping process, workers scrape off non-fibrous matter, then dig in and grab the fibers from within the jute stem.[8][clarification needed] Jute is a rain-fed crop with little need for fertilizer or pesticides, in contrast to cotton's heavy requirements.[citation needed][9] Production in India is concentrated mostly in West Bengal.[10] India is the world's largest producer of jute,[11][12] but imported approximately 162,000 tonnes[13] of raw fiber and 175,000 tonnes[14] of jute products in 2011. India, Pakistan, and China import significant quantities of jute fiber and products from Bangladesh, as do the United Kingdom, Japan, United States, France, Spain, Ivory Coast, Germany and Brazil. Jute and jute products formerly held the top position among Bangladesh's most exported goods, although now they stand second after ready-made apparel.[15] Annually, Bangladesh produces 7 to 8 million bales of raw jute, out of which 0.6 to 0.8 million bales are exported to international markets. China, India, and Pakistan are the primary importers of Bangladeshi raw jute.\n\n### Genome\nIn 2002, Bangladesh commissioned a consortium of researchers from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh Jute Research Institute (BJRI) and private software firm DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Ltd., in collaboration with the Centre for Chemical Biology, University of Science Malaysia and University of Hawaiʻi, to research different fibers and hybrid fibers of jute. The draft genome of jute (Corchorus olitorius) was completed.[17]\n\n### Uses\nJutes are relatively cheap and versatile fiber and have a wide variety of uses in cordage and cloth. It is commonly used to make burlap sacks. The jute plant also has some culinary uses, which are generally focused on the leaves. Due to its durability and biodegradability, jute matting is used as a temporary solution to prevent flood erosion. Researchers have also investigated the possibility of using jute and glucose to build aeroplane panels.[18]\n\n### Fibers\nIndividual jute fibers can range from very fine to very coarse, and the varied fibers are suited for a variety of uses. The coarser fibers, which are called jute butts, are used alone or combined with other fibers to make many products: Finer jute fibers can be processed for use in: Jute was historically[when?][where?] used in traditional textile machinery[which?] because jute fibers contain cellulose (vegetable fiber) and lignin (wood fiber).[further explanation needed] Later[when?], several industries, such as the automotive, pulp and paper, furniture, and bedding industries, started to use jute and its allied[clarification needed] fibers with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwoven fabric, technical textiles, and composites. Jute is used in the manufacture of fabrics, such as Hessian cloth, sacking, scrim, carpet backing cloth (CBC), and canvas. Hessian is lighter than sacking, and it is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, which is a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types: primary and secondary. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is sometimes used as an environmentally friendly substitute for plastic. Other jute consumer products include floor coverings, high performance technical textiles, geotextiles, and composites. Jute has been used as a home textile due to its anti-static and color- and light-fast properties, as well as its strength, durability, Ultraviolet protection, sound and heat insulation, and low thermal conductivity.\n\n### Culinary Uses\nCorchous olitorius leaves are used to make mulukhiya, which is sometimes considered the Egyptian national dish, and is also consumed in Cyprus and other Middle Eastern countries. These leaves are an ingredient in stews, typically coo",

    "title": "Cocoa Bean",
    "content": "### Etymology\nCocoa is a variant of cacao, likely due to confusion with the word coco.[3] It is ultimately derived from kakaw(a), but whether that word originates in Nahuatl or a Mixe-Zoquean language is the subject of substantial linguistic debate.[3][4] The term cocoa beans originated in the 19th century; during the 18th century they were called chocolate nuts, cocoa nuts or just cocoa.[5]\n\n### History\nThe cacao tree is native to the Amazon rainforest. It was first domesticated at least 5,300 years ago, in equatorial South America from the Santa Ana-La Florida (SALF) site in what is present-day southeast Ecuador (Zamora-Chinchipe Province) by the Mayo-Chinchipe culture, before being introduced in Mesoamerica.[2][6] More than 3,000 years ago, it was consumed by pre-Hispanic cultures along the Yucatán, including the Maya,[7] and as far back as Olmeca civilization[8] in spiritual ceremonies.[9][10] It also grows in the foothills of the Andes in the Amazon region and the Orinoco basins of South America, such as in Colombia and Venezuela.[11][12] Wild cacao still grows there.[13][14][15] Its range may have been larger in the past; evidence of its wild range may be obscured by cultivation of the tree in these areas since long before the Spanish arrived.[16] As of 2018, evidence suggests that cacao was first domesticated in equatorial South America,[17] before being domesticated in Central America roughly 1,500 years later.[6] Artifacts found at Santa-Ana-La Florida, in Ecuador, indicate that the Mayo-Chinchipe people were cultivating cacao as long as 5,300 years ago.[6] Chemical analysis of residue extracted from pottery excavated at an archaeological site at Puerto Escondido, in Honduras, indicates that cocoa products were first consumed there sometime between 1500 and 1400 BC. Evidence also indicates that, long before the flavor of the cacao seed (or bean) became popular, the sweet pulp of the chocolate fruit, used in making a fermented (5.34% alcohol) beverage, first drew attention to the plant in the Americas.[18] The cocoa bean was a common currency throughout Mesoamerica before the Spanish conquest.[19]: 2 The bean was utilized in pre-modern Latin America to purchase small items such as tamales and rabbit dinners. A greater quantity of cocoa beans was used to purchase turkey hens and other large items.[20] Cacao trees grow in a limited geographical zone, of about 20° to the north and south of the Equator.[21][22] More than 70% of the world's cacao crop is grown in Africa, with Ivory Coast and Ghana producing approximately 58% of global production.[22][23][24] The cacao plant was first given its botanical name by Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus in his original classification of the plant kingdom, where he called it Theobroma (\"food of the gods\") cacao.[25] Cocoa was an important commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.[26] A Spanish soldier who was on Hernan Cortés' side during the conquest of the Aztec Empire tells that when Moctezuma II, emperor of the Aztecs, dined, he took no other beverage than chocolate, served in a golden goblet. Flavored with vanilla or other spices, his chocolate was whipped into a froth that dissolved in the mouth. No fewer than 60 portions each day reportedly may have been consumed by Moctezuma II, and 2,000 more by the nobles of his court.[27] Chocolate was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by the mid-17th century.[28] Venezuela became the largest producer of cocoa beans in the world.[29] Spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines.[30] It was also introduced into the rest of Asia, South Asia and into West Africa by Europeans. In the Gold Coast, modern Ghana, cacao was introduced by a Ghanaian, Tetteh Quarshie.\n\n### Varieties\nCocoa beans are traditionally classified into three main varieties: Forastero, Criollo and Trinitario. Use of these terms has changed across different contexts and times, and recent genetic research has found that the categories of Forastero and Trinitario are better understood as geohistorical inventions rather than as having a botanical basis. They are still used frequently in marketing material.[31] Criollo has traditionally been the most prized variety. Believed to have been native to South America, by the time of the Spanish conquest they were grown in Mesoamerica.[32] After European colonization, disease and population decrease led to the Spanish and Portuguese using different cacao varieties from South America. Different from the Criollo beans, these new beans were named Forastero, which can be translated as strange or foreign. They are generally of the Amelonado type and are associated with West Africa.[32] Trinitario refers to any hybrid between Criollo and Forastero.[32]\n\n### Cultivation\nA cocoa pod (fruit) is about 17 to 20 cm (6.7 to 7.9 in) long and has a rough, leathery rind about 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.18 in) thick (varying with the origin and variety of pod) filled with sweet, mucilaginous pulp (called baba de cacao in South America) with a lemonade-like taste enclosing 30 to 50 large seeds that are fairly soft and a pale lavender to dark brownish purple color.[33] During harvest, the pods are opened, the seeds are kept, and the empty pods are discarded and the pulp made into juice. The seeds are placed where they can ferment. Due to heat buildup in the fermentation process, cacao beans lose most of the purplish hue and become mostly brown in color, with an adhered skin which includes the dried remains of the fruity pulp. This skin is released easily by winnowing after roasting. White seeds are found in some rare varieties, usually mixed with purples, and are considered of higher value.[34][35]\n\n### Harvesting\nCacao trees grow in hot, rainy tropical areas within 20° of latitude from the Equator. Cocoa harvest is not restricted to one period per year and a harvest typically occurs over several months. In fact, in many countries, cocoa can be harvested at any time of the year.[19] Pesticides are often applied to the trees to combat capsid bugs, and fungicides to fight black pod disease.[36] Immature cocoa pods have a variety of colours, but most often are green, red, or purple, and as they mature, their colour tends towards yellow or orange, particularly in the creases.[19][37] Unlike most fruiting trees, the cacao pod grows directly from the trunk or large branch of a tree rather than from the end of a branch, similar to jackfruit. This makes harvesting by hand easier as most of the pods will not be up in the higher branches. The pods on a tree do not ripen together; harvesting needs to be done periodically through the year.[19] Harvesting occurs between three and four times weekly during the harvest season.[19] The ripe and near-ripe pods, as judged by their colour, are harvested from the trunk and branches of the cacao tree with a curved knife on a long pole. Care must be used when cutting the stem of the pod to avoid damaging the junction of the stem with the tree, as this is where future flowers and pods will emerge.[19][38] One person can harvest an estimated 650 pods per day.[36][39]\n\n### Harvest Processing\nThe harvested pods are opened, typically with a machete, to expose the beans.[19][36] The pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded. The pulp and seeds are then piled in heaps, placed in bins, or laid out on grates for several days. During this time, the seeds and pulp undergo \"sweating\", where the thick pulp liquefies as it ferments. The fermented pulp trickles away, leaving cocoa seeds behind to be collected. At the end of this process, the seeds change color from pale yellow or violet to brown.[40] Sweating is important for the quality of the beans,[41] which originally have a strong, bitter taste. If sweating is interrupted, the resulting cocoa may be ruined; if underdone, the cocoa seed maintains a flavor similar to raw potatoes and becomes susceptible to mildew. Some cocoa-p",

    "content": "### Terminology\nThe term pulse, as used by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is reserved for legume crops harvested solely for the dry seed.[1] This excludes green beans and green peas, which are considered vegetable crops. Also excluded are seeds that are mainly grown for oil extraction (oilseeds like soybeans and peanuts),[2] and seeds which are used exclusively for sowing forage (clovers, alfalfa).[3] However, in common usage, these distinctions are not always clearly made, and many of the varieties used for dried pulses are also used for green vegetables, with their beans in pods while young.[4] Some Fabaceae, such as Scotch broom and other Genisteae, are leguminous but are usually not called legumes by farmers, who tend to restrict that term to food crops.[5] The FAO recognizes 11 primary pulses, excluding green vegetable legumes (e.g. green peas) and legumes used mainly for oil extraction (e.g., soybeans and groundnuts) or used only as seed (e.g., clover and alfalfa).[6]\n\n### Distribution\nLegumes are widely distributed as the third-largest land plant family in terms of number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 751 genera and some 19,000 known species,[7][8] constituting about seven percent of flowering plant species.[9][10]\n\n### Nitrogen Fixation\nMany legumes contain symbiotic bacteria called Rhizobia within root nodules of their root systems (plants belonging to the genus Styphnolobium are one exception to this rule). These bacteria have the special ability of fixing nitrogen from atmospheric, molecular nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3).[11] The chemical reaction is: Ammonia is converted to another form, ammonium (NH+4), usable by (some) plants, by the following reaction: This arrangement means that the root nodules are sources of nitrogen for legumes, making them relatively rich in nitrogenous amino acids and protein. Nitrogen is therefore a necessary ingredient in the production of proteins. When a legume plant dies in the field, for example following the harvest, all of its remaining nitrogen, incorporated into amino acids inside the remaining plant parts, is released back into the soil. In the soil, the amino acids are converted to nitrate (NO−3), making the nitrogen available to other plants, thereby serving as fertilizer for future crops.[12][13] In many traditional and organic farming practices, crop rotation or polyculture involving legumes is common. By alternating between legumes and non-legumes, or by growing both together for part of the growing season, the field can receive a sufficient amount of nitrogenous compounds to produce a good result without adding nitrogenous fertilizer. Legumes are often used as green manure.[citation needed] Sri Lanka developed the polyculture practice known as coconut-soybean intercropping. Grain legumes are grown in coconut (Cocos nuficera) groves in two ways: intercropping or as a cash crop. These are grown mainly for their protein, vegetable oil and ability to uphold soil fertility.[14] However, continuous cropping after 3–4 years decrease grain yields significantly.[15]\n\n### Pests And Diseases\nA common pest of grain legumes that is noticed in the tropical and subtropical Asia, Africa, Australia and Oceania are minuscule flies that belong to the family Agromyzidae, dubbed \"bean flies\". They are considered to be the most destructive. The host range of these flies is very wide amongst cultivated legumes. Infestation of plants starts from germination through to harvest, and they can destroy an entire crop in early stage.[16] Black bean aphids are a serious pest to broad beans and other beans. Common hosts for this pest are fathen, thistle and dock. Pea weevil and bean weevil damage leaf margins leaving characteristics semi-circular notches. Stem nematodes are very widespread but will be found more frequently in areas where host plants are grown.[17] Common legume diseases include anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum trifolii; common leaf spot caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae; crown wart caused by Physoderma alfalfae; downy mildew caused by Peronospora trifoliorum; root rot caused by Fusarium spp.; rust caused by Uromyces striatus; crown and stem rot caused by Sclerotinia trifoliorum; Southern blight caused by Sclerotium rolfsii; pythium (browning) root rot caused by Pythium spp.; fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum; root knot caused by Meloidogyne hapla. These are all classified as biotic problems.[18] Abiotic problems include nutrient deficiencies, (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, magnesium, manganese, boron, zinc), pollutants (air, water, soil, pesticide injury, fertilizer burn), toxic concentration of minerals, and unfavorable growth conditions.[19]\n\n### Storage\nSeed viability decreases with longer storage time. Studies of vetch, broad beans, and peas show that they last about 5 years in storage. Environmental factors that are important in influencing germination are relative humidity and temperature. Two rules apply to moisture content between 5 and 14 percent: the life of the seed will last longer if the storage temperature is reduced by 5 degree Celsius. Secondly, the storage moisture content will decrease if temperature is reduced by 1 degree Celsius.[20]\n\n### Uses\nCultivated legumes encompass a diverse range of agricultural classifications, spanning forage, grain, flowering, pharmaceutical/industrial, fallow/green manure, and timber categories. A notable characteristic of many commercially cultivated legume species is their versatility, often assuming multiple roles concurrently. The extent of these roles is contingent upon the stage of maturity at which they are harvested.[citation needed]\n\n### Human Consumption\nGrain legumes are cultivated for their seeds,[21] for humans and animals to eat, or for oils for industrial uses. Grain legumes include beans, lentils, lupins, peas, and peanuts.[22] Legumes are a key ingredient in vegan meat and dairy substitutes. They are growing in use as a plant-based protein source in the world marketplace.[23][24] Products containing legumes grew by 39% in Europe between 2013 and 2017.[25] There is a common misconception that adding salt before cooking prevents them from cooking through. Legumes may not soften because they are old, or because of hard water or acidic ingredients in the pot; salting before cooking results in better seasoning.[26][27] Legumes are a significant source of protein, dietary fibre, carbohydrates, and dietary minerals; for example, a 100-gram serving of cooked chickpeas contains 18 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for protein, 30 percent DV for dietary fiber, 43 percent DV for folate and 52 percent DV for manganese.[28] Legumes are an excellent source of resistant starch; this is broken down by bacteria in the large intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids (such as butyrate) used by intestinal cells for food energy.[29]\n\n### Forage\nForage legumes are of two broad types. Some, like alfalfa, clover, vetch (Vicia), stylo (Stylosanthes), or Arachis, are sown in pasture and grazed by livestock. Others, such as Leucaena or Albizia, are woody shrubs or trees that are either broken down by livestock or regularly cut by humans to provide fodder. Legume-based feeds improve animal performance over a diet of perennial grasses. Factors include larger consumption, faster digestion, and higher feed conversion rate.[30] The type of crop grown for animal rearing depends on the farming system. In cattle rearing, legume trees such as Gliricidia sepium can be planted along edges of fields to provide shade for cattle, the leaves and bark are often eaten by cattle. Green manure can be grown between harvesting the main crop and the planting of the next crop.[31]\n\n### Other Uses\nLegume species grown for their flowers include lupins, which are farmed commercially for their blooms as well as being popular in gardens worldwide. Industrially farmed legumes include Indigofera ",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word \"soy\" derives from the Japanese soi, a regional variant of shōyu,[10] which in turn comes from the Chinese jiangyou (醬油), meaning \"soy sauce\".[11] The name of the genus, Glycine, comes from Linnaeus. When naming the genus, Linnaeus observed that one of the species formerly within the genus, which has since been reclassified to the genus Apios, had a sweet root. Based on the sweetness, the Greek word for sweet, glykós, was Latinized.[12] The genus name is not related to the amino acid glycine.[citation needed]\n\n### Description\nLike most plants, soybeans grow in distinct morphological stages as they develop from seeds into fully mature plants.\n\n### Germination\nThe first stage of growth is germination, a method which first becomes apparent as a seed's radicle emerges.[13] This is the first stage of root growth and occurs within the first 48 hours under ideal growing conditions. The first photosynthetic structures, the cotyledons, develop from the hypocotyl, the first plant structure to emerge from the soil. These cotyledons both act as leaves and as a source of nutrients for the immature plant, providing the seedling nutrition for its first 7 to 10 days.[13]\n\n### Maturation\nThe first true leaves develop as a pair of single blades.[13] Subsequent to this first pair, mature nodes form compound leaves with three blades. Mature trifoliolate leaves, having three to four leaflets per leaf, are often between 6 and 15 cm (2+1⁄2 and 6 in) long and 2 and 7 cm (1 and 3 in) broad. Under ideal conditions, stem growth continues, producing new nodes every four days. Before flowering, roots can grow 2 cm (3⁄4 in) per day. If rhizobia are present, root nodulation begins by the time the third node appears. Nodulation typically continues for 8 weeks before the symbiotic infection process stabilizes.[13] The final characteristics of a soybean plant are variable, with factors such as genetics, soil quality, and climate affecting its form; however, fully mature soybean plants are generally between 50 and 125 cm (20 and 50 in) in height[14] and have rooting depths between 75 and 150 cm (30 and 60 in).[15]\n\n### Flowering\nFlowering is triggered by day length, often beginning once days become shorter than 12.8 hours.[13] This trait is highly variable however, with different varieties reacting differently to changing day length.[16] Soybeans form inconspicuous, self-fertile flowers which are borne in the axil of the leaf and are white, pink or purple. Though they do not require pollination, they are attractive to bees, because they produce nectar that is high in sugar content.[17] Depending on the soybean variety, node growth may cease once flowering begins. Strains that continue nodal development after flowering are termed \"indeterminates\" and are best suited to climates with longer growing seasons.[13] Often soybeans drop their leaves before the seeds are fully mature. The fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of three to five, each pod is 3–8 cm (1–3 in) long and usually contains two to four (rarely more) seeds 5–11 mm in diameter. Soybean seeds come in a wide variety of sizes and hull colors such as black, brown, yellow, and green.[14] Variegated and bicolored seed coats are also common.\n\n### Seed Resilience\nThe hull of the mature bean is hard, water-resistant, and protects the cotyledon and hypocotyl (or \"germ\") from damage. If the seed coat is cracked, the seed will not germinate. The scar, visible on the seed coat, is called the hilum (colors include black, brown, buff, gray and yellow) and at one end of the hilum is the micropyle, or small opening in the seed coat which can allow the absorption of water for sprouting. Some seeds such as soybeans containing very high levels of protein can undergo desiccation, yet survive and revive after water absorption. A. Carl Leopold began studying this capability at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University in the mid-1980s. He found soybeans and corn to have a range of soluble carbohydrates protecting the seed's cell viability.[18] Patents were awarded to him in the early 1990s on techniques for protecting biological membranes and proteins in the dry state.\n\n### Chemistry\nDry soybeans contain 36% protein and 20% fat in form of soybean oil by weight. The remainder consists of 30% carbohydrates, 9% water and 5% ash.[19] \nSoybeans comprise approximately 8% seed coat or hull, 90% cotyledons and 2% hypocotyl axis or germ.[20][page needed]\n\n### Taxonomy\nThe genus Glycine may be divided into two subgenera, Glycine and Soja. The subgenus Soja includes the cultivated soybean, G. max, and the wild soybean, treated either as a separate species G. soja,[21] or as the subspecies G. max subsp. soja.[2] The cultivated and wild soybeans are annuals. The wild soybean is native to China, Japan, Korea and Russia.[21] The subgenus Glycine consists of at least 25 wild perennial species: for example, G. canescens and G. tomentella, both found in Australia and Papua New Guinea.[22][23] Perennial soybean (Neonotonia wightii) belongs to a different genus. It originated in Africa and is now a widespread pasture crop in the tropics.[24][25][26] Like some other crops of long domestication, the relationship of the modern soybean to wild-growing species can no longer be traced with any degree of certainty.[27] It is a cultigen with a very large number of cultivars.[28]\n\n### Subspecies\nAs of November 2025[update], Plants of the World Online accepted the following subspecies:[29]\n\n### Ecology\nLike many legumes, soybeans can fix atmospheric nitrogen, due to the presence of symbiotic bacteria from the Rhizobia group.[30]\n\n### Cultivation\nSoybeans are globally important agricultural crops, grown as a major source of protein and oil. It prefers fertile, well-drained soils and requires a warm temperate climate with adequate rainfall or irrigation. Soybeans are mainly grown in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina.[31] It is usually planted in straight rows using modern machinery, and pests and weeds must be controlled to maintain the crop. After maturity, it is harvested using mechanized harvesting machines. Soybeans are used in the production of many food and industrial products, such as tofu, oils, and feed, in addition to their role in improving soil fertility by fixing nitrogen.\n\n### Conditions\nCultivation is successful in climates with hot summers, with optimum growing conditions in mean temperatures of 20 to 30 °C (70 to 85 °F); temperatures of below 20 °C (70 °F) and over 40 °C (105 °F) stunt growth significantly. They can grow in a wide range of soils, with optimum growth in moist alluvial soils with good organic content. Soybeans, like most legumes, perform nitrogen fixation by establishing a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum (syn. Rhizobium japonicum; Jordan 1982). This ability to fix nitrogen allows farmers to reduce nitrogen fertilizer use and increase yields when growing other crops in rotation with soy.[32] There may be some trade-offs, however, in the long-term abundance of organic material in soils where soy and other crops (for example, corn) are grown in rotation.[33] For best results, though, an inoculum of the correct strain of bacteria should be mixed with the soybean (or any legume) seed before planting. Modern crop cultivars generally reach a height of around 1 m (3 ft), and take 80–120 days from sowing to harvesting.\n\n### Soils\nSoil scientists Edson Lobato (Brazil), Andrew McClung (U.S.), and Alysson Paolinelli (Brazil) were awarded the 2006 World Food Prize for transforming the ecologically biodiverse savannah of the Cerrado region of Brazil into highly productive cropland that could grow profitable soybeans.[34][35][36][37]\n\n### Contamination Concerns\nHuman sewage sludge can be used as fertilizer to grow soybeans. Soybeans grown in sewage sludge likely contain elevated concentrations of metals.[38][39]\n\n### Pests\nSoybean plants are vulnerable to a wid",

    "content": "### Etymology\nChickpeas have been cultivated for at least ten thousand years.[11] Cultivation spread from the Fertile Crescent eastward toward South Asia and into Europe through the Balkans.[12][13] Historical linguistics have found ancestral words relating to chickpeas in the prehistoric Proto-Indo-European language family that evolved into the Indo-European languages.[14] The Proto-Indo-European roots *kek- and *k'ik'- that denoted both 'pea' and 'oat' appeared in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe between 4,500 and 2,500 BCE.[15]: 49 [16][17] As speakers of the language became isolated from each other through the Indo-European migrations, the regional dialects diverged due to contact with other languages and dialects, and transformed into the known ancient Indo-European languages.[18]: 243–244  The Old Prussian word kekêrs, appearing between 1 and 100 CE, retained the 'pea' meaning of the word, but in most cases, the word came to be used to denote chickpeas.[16] In Old Macedonian, the word κίκερροι appeared between 1000 and 400 BCE, and may have evolved from the Proto-Hellenic word *κικριός.[16] In Ancient Rome, the Latin word cicer for chickpeas appeared around 700 BCE,[16] and is probably derived from the word kickere used by the Pelasgians that inhabited north Greece before Greek-speaking tribes took over.[19]: 13  The Old Armenian word siseŕn for chickpeas appeared before 400 CE.[16] Over time, linkages between languages led to other descendant words, including the Albanian word qiqër, the Swedish word kikärt, the Slovak word cícer, the Estonian word kikerhernes, the Basque word txitxirio, and the Maltese word cicra.[14] The Latin word cicer evolved into words for chickpeas in nearly all extinct and living Romance languages, including the Mozarabic word chíchar; the Catalan words ceirons, cigró, cigronera, cigrons and ciurons; the Walloon words poes d' souke; the Old French words ceire and cice; and the Modern French terms cicérole, cicer tete-de-belier, and pois chiche.[15]: 50  These words were borrowed by many geographically neighboring languages, such as the French term pois chiche becoming chich-pease in Old English.[20][11] The word pease, like the modern words for wheat and corn, was both singular and plural, but since it had an \"s\" sound at the end of it which became associated with the plural form of nouns, English speakers by the end of the 17th century were starting to refer to a single grain of pease as a pea.[11] Other important Proto-Indo-European roots relating to chickpeas are *erəgw[h]-, *eregw(h)o-, and *erogw(h)o-, which were used to denote both the kernel of a legume and a pea.[15]: 51  This root evolved into the Greek word erebinthos, mentioned in The Iliad in around 800 BCE and in Historia Plantarum by Theophrastus, written between 350 and 287 BCE.[19]: 13  The Portuguese words ervanço and gravanço; the Asturian word garbanzu; the Galician word garavanzo; the French words garvanche, garvance, and garvane; and the Spanish word garbanzo are all related to the Greek term.[15]: 51 [19]: 13  In American English, the term garbanzo to refer to the chickpea appeared in writing as early as 1759,[21]: 87  and the seed is also referred to as a garbanzo bean.[21]: 88 [22]: 34\n\n### Taxonomy\nChickpea (Cicer arietinum) is a member of the genus Cicer and the legume family, Fabaceae.[23]: 231  Carl Linnaeus described it in the first edition of Species Plantarum in 1753, marking the first use of binomial nomenclature for the plant.[22]: 11  Linnaeus classified the plant in the genus Cicer, which was the Latin term for chickpeas,[22]: 2  crediting Joseph Pitton de Tournefort's 1694 publication Elemens de botanique, ou Methode pour connoitre les plantes which called it \"Cicer arietinum\".[22]: 11  Tournefort himself repeated the names of the plant that had been used since antiquity.[22]: 11 The specific epithet arietinum is based on the shape of the seed resembling the head of a ram.[19]: 3  In Ancient Greece, Theophrastus described one of the varieties of chickpea called \"rams\" in Historia Plantarum.[24]: 173  The Roman writer on agriculture Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella wrote about chickpeas in the second book of De re rustica, published in about 64 CE,[25]: xiv  and said that the chickpea was called arietillum.[25]: 169  Pliny the Elder expanded further in Naturalis Historia that this name was due to the seed's resemblance to the head of a ram.[25]: 169 Cicer arietinum is the type species of the genus.[22]: 10  The wild species C. reticulatum is interfertile with C. arietinum and is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated species.[26] Cicer echinospermum is also closely related and can be hybridized with both C. reticulatum and C. arietinum, but generally produce infertile seeds.[26]\n\n### History\nThe chickpea was originally domesticated along with wheat, barley, peas, and lentils during the First Agricultural Revolution about 10,000 years ago.[26] The closest evolutionary relative to chickpeas is Cicer reticulatum, a plant native to a relatively small area in the Southeastern part of modern-day Turkey and nearby areas in modern-day Syria.[27][23]: 231  Initially, ancient hunter-gatherer cultures harvested wild plants that they encountered, but evidence of the cultivation of some domestic food crops from 7500 BCE and possibly earlier have been documented.[28]: 1 Archaeological sites in modern Syria, such as Tell El-Kerkh and Tell Abu Hureyra, have revealed remnant traces of peas, lentils, and fava beans, along with grain legumes including chickpeas, bitter vetch, and grass peas from the 8th millennium BCE.[13][28]: 1  Samples from Tell El-Kerkh have been analyzed, revealing traces of both the cultivated C. arietinum and the wild C. reticulatum. Additional discoveries have been made at Çayönü in Turkey dating from between 7500 and 6800 BCE, and at Hacilar in Turkey that date from 5450 BCE.[28]: 1 Cultivation of domesticated chickpea is well documented from 3300 BCE onwards in Egypt and the Middle East.[28]: 1–2  During the Neolithic Era, chickpea cultivation spread to the west and was established in present-day Greece by the late Neolithic Era.[28]: 2  During the Bronze Age, chickpea cultivation spread to Crete and as far as upper Egypt, with specimens from 1400 BCE found at Deir el-Medina. At the same time, it spread to the east, and chickpeas from 1900 BCE were found at Tell Bazmusian. In the Indian subcontinent, archaeological evidence of chickpea cultivation at Lal Quila, Sanghol, Inamgaon, Nevasa, Hulas, Senuwar, and Daimabad date from between 1750 and 1500 BCE. By the Iron Age, cultivation had spread as far south as Lalibela in Ethiopia.[28]: 2–4  The Spanish and Portuguese introduced chickpea cultivation to the New World in the 16th century.[28]: 5 The process of domestication involved the selective breeding of plants that produced large, palatable seeds that do not require a dormancy period, plants that have seeds that are easy to separate from the pods, plants with a predictable ripening period to allow a whole field to ripen at once, and plants with desirable physical forms.[23]: 231  This selective breeding produced several different varieties of chickpeas. In Greece, Theophrastus wrote \"Chickpeas ... differ in size, color, taste, and shape; there are the varieties called 'rams' and 'vetch-like' chickpeas, and the intermediate forms\" in Historia Plantarum, written between 350 and 287 BCE.[24]: 173 One key selection factor in the domestication of chickpeas was the selection of a spring-sown cropping season. The evolutionary relatives of Cicer arietinum grow during the Winter and are harvested in the Spring.[26] In the Near East, more than 80 percent of annual precipitation occurs between the months of December and February, while the long summers are hot and dry.[29]: 38  Growing in the damp Winter months made the crops vulnerable to Ascochyta blight caused by Didymella rabiei, resulting in crop failures.[2",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe English word \"lentil\" ultimately derives from the Latin lens (\"lentil\"). The Latin word is of classical Roman or Latin origin and may be the source of the prominent Roman family name Lentulus, just as the family name \"Cicero\" was derived from the chickpea, Cicer arietinum, and \"Fabia\" (as in Quintus Fabius Maximus) from the fava bean (Vicia faba).[2]\n\n### Taxonomy\nThe genus Vicia is part of the subfamily Faboideae which is contained in the flowering plant family Fabaceae or commonly known as legume or bean family, of the order Fabales in the kingdom Plantae.[3] The former genus Lens, now considered a section of genus Vicia, consisted of the cultivated L. culinaris and six related wild taxa. As members of genus Lens, these six are Lens orientalis, Lens tomentosus, Lens lamottei, Lens odemensis, Lens ervoides, and Lens nigricans. The seven members are often referred to as \"taxa\" instead of \"species\" and/or \"subspecies\", as while it is broadly agreed there are seven of them, whether they constitute distinct species is not broadly agreed on. Among the wild taxa, L. orientalis is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil L. culinaris. Of the taxa, L. culinaris and L. orientalis are most often considered subspecies, and so are often also classified as L. culinaris subsp. culinaris and L. culinaris subsp. orientalis respectively.[4] Following reassignment to genus Vicia, they may also be referred to as Vicia lens subsp. culinaris and Vicia lens subsp. orientalis.\n\n### Botanical Description\nLentil is hypogeal, which means the cotyledons of the germinating seed stay in the ground and inside the seed coat. Therefore, it is less vulnerable to frost, wind erosion, or insect attack.[5] The plant is a diploid, annual, bushy herb of erect, semierect, or spreading and compact growth and normally varies from 30 to 50 centimetres (12 to 20 in) in height. It has many hairy branches and its stem is slender and angular. The rachis bears 10 to 15 leaflets in five to eight pairs. The leaves are alternate, of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour. In general, the upper leaves are converted into tendrils, whereas the lower leaves are mucronate. If stipules are present, they are small. The flowers, one to four in number, are small, white, pink, purple, pale purple, or pale blue in colour. They arise from the axils of the leaves, on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves. The pods are oblong, slightly inflated, and about 1.5 centimetres (5⁄8 in) long. Normally, each of them contains two seeds, about 0.5 centimetres (1⁄4 in) in diameter, in the characteristic lens shape. The seeds can also be mottled and speckled. The several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size, hairiness, and colour of the leaves, flowers, and seeds. Lentils are self-pollinating. The flowering begins from the lowermost buds and gradually moves upward, so-called acropetal flowering. About two weeks are needed for all the flowers to open on the single branch. At the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers, they close completely and the colour begins to fade. After three to four days, the setting of the pods takes place.[4]\n\n### Types\nLentil may be classified for market based on an array of seed qualities. These qualities may include the size, shape (\"round\" or \"lens\"), seed coat colour and pattern, seed coat thickness, and internal cotyledon colour. The parameters for market type or classification name may also vary according to region. Additionally, when sold, lentil may be further classified according to whether it is hulled (seed coat removed) or unhulled, and if hulled, whether the cotyledon inside is split or left whole. Lentil seed coat colour can be broadly grouped into tan, grey, green, brown, clear or black, the first four of which will slowly turn brown over time. Black seed coat, which can present solid black (almost purple) or slightly patchy, acts like a pattern, masking the \"ground\" colour (tan, grey, green or brown) beneath, while clear coats lack pigmentation altogether.[6] Seed coat colour is also influenced by the colour of the cotyledon, though this does not usually affect market classification. Seed coat patterning is usually selected against in most market types with the exception of Puy or \"French green\" lentil, which has \"marbled\" patterning. As well as \"marbled\" (which comes in two genetic variants termed Marbled-1 and Marbled-2), coats may be \"spotted\", \"dotted\", \"mottled\", or show complex/mixed patterns.[7] Seed coat colour is determined by the genotype of the seed parent, rather than the genetics of the plant the seed will become. Common cotyledon colours are an orange-red colour and a light yellow, usually just called \"red\" (occasionally \"orange\") and \"yellow\" respectively. Three other colours, a brown-yellow, a light green, and a dark green have also been documented.\n\n### Red Lentil\nRed lentil varieties are defined by their red cotyledon, and moderate to thin seed coat. Red lentil varieties tend to be smaller than those of their green/brown counterparts, with large red lentil varieties meeting a similar size to small green lentil varieties. As the seed coat of red lentil is often removed, colour and pattern aren't usually selected for, though in recent years Australian red lentil varieties have been standardised for grey seed coats to allow for cultivars to be mixed. Australia is the largest producer of red lentil.\n\n### Green And Brown Lentil\nGreen and brown lentil varieties have yellow cotyledon, usually moderate or thin, and green or brown seed coats. Canada is the largest producer of green lentil. These lentils are sometimes referred to by notable historic cultivars instead of by size, especially in North America: for example, small green lentil may be referred to as Eston-types, large green lentils as Laird-types, and large brown lentil as Brewer-types.[8][9] These lentils rarely hold their shape when cooked, and so are often used in soups or stews.\n\n### Specialty Types\nBlack lentil Regional types Other\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of dry lentils was 7 million tonnes, led by Australia, Canada, and India, which together accounted for 72% of the total (table).\n\n### History\nThe cultivated lentil Vicia lens subsp. lens was derived from its wild subspecies V. lens subsp. orientalis, although other species may also have contributed some genes, according to Jonathan Sauer (Historical Geography of Crop Plants, 2017).[12] Unlike their wild ancestors, domesticated lentil crops have indehiscent pods and non-dormant seeds.[12] Lentil was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East and then spread to Europe and North Africa and the Indo-Gangetic plain. The primary center of diversity for the domestic Vicia lens as well as its wild progenitor V. lens ssp. lamottei is considered to be the Middle East. The oldest known carbonized remains of lentil from Greece's Franchthi Cave are dated to 11,000 BC. In archaeobotanical excavations carbonized remains of lentil seeds have been recovered from widely dispersed places such as Tell Ramad in Syria (6250–5950 BC), Aceramic Beidha in Jordan, Hacilar in Turkey (5800–5000 BC), Tepe Sabz (Ita. Tepe Sabz) in Iran (5500–5000 BC) and Argissa-Magula Tessaly in Greece (6000–5000 BC), among other places.[13] Lentils were part of the ancient Israelite diet, served roasted or prepared as a soup/stew, as indicated by several biblical passages. Archaeological excavations at Tel Beit Shemesh have uncovered lentil remains dating from the Iron Age.[14]\n\n### Soil Requirements\nLentils can grow on various soil types, from sand to clay loam, growing best in deep sandy loam soils with moderate fertility. A soil pH around 7 would be the best. Lentils do not tolerate flooding or water-logged conditions.[3] Lentils improve the physical properties of soils and increase the yield of succeeding cereal crops. Biological n",

    "content": "### Botanical Description\nThe peanut is an annual herbaceous plant growing 30 to 50 centimetres (12 to 20 in) tall.[9] As a legume, it belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae, also known as Leguminosae, and commonly known as the legume, bean, or pea family.[1] Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules.[7] The leaves are opposite and pinnate with four leaflets (two opposite pairs; no terminal leaflet); each leaflet is 1 to 7 cm (1⁄2 to 2+3⁄4 in) long and 1 to 3 cm (1⁄2 to 1+1⁄4 in) across. Like those of many other legumes, the leaves are nyctinastic; that is, they have \"sleep\" movements, closing at night.[10] The flowers are 1 to 1.5 cm (3⁄8 to 5⁄8 in) across, and yellowish orange with reddish veining.[11][9] They are borne in axillary clusters on the stems above ground and last for just one day. The ovary is located at the base of what appears to be the flower stem but is a highly elongated floral cup.[citation needed] Peanut fruits develop underground, an unusual feature known as geocarpy.[12] After fertilization, a short stalk at the base of the ovary—often termed a gynophore, but which appears to be part of the ovary—elongates to form a thread-like structure known as a \"peg\". This peg grows into the soil, allowing the fruit to develop underground.[12] These pods, technically called legumes, are 3 to 7 centimetres (1 to 3 in) long, normally containing one to four seeds.[11][9] The shell of the peanut fruit consists primarily of a mesocarp with several large veins traversing its length.[12] Parts of the peanut include:\n\n### Phytochemistry\nPeanuts contain polyphenols, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, phytosterols, and dietary fiber in amounts similar to several tree nuts.[13] Peanut skins contain resveratrol.[14]\n\n### History\nThe Arachis genus is native to South America, east of the Andes, around Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil.[15] Cultivated peanuts (A. hypogaea) arose from a hybrid between two wild species of peanut, thought to be A. duranensis and A. ipaensis.[15][16][17] The initial hybrid would have been sterile, but spontaneous chromosome doubling restored its fertility, forming what is termed an amphidiploid or allotetraploid.[15] Genetic analysis suggests the hybridization may have occurred only once and gave rise to A. monticola, a wild form of peanut that occurs in a few limited locations in northwestern Argentina, or in southeastern Bolivia, where the peanut landraces with the most wild-like features are grown today,[11] and by artificial selection to A. hypogaea.[15][16] The process of domestication through artificial selection made A. hypogaea dramatically different from its wild relatives. The domesticated plants are bushier, more compact, and have a different pod structure and larger seeds. From this center of origin, cultivation spread and formed secondary and tertiary centers of diversity in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Over time, thousands of peanut landraces evolved; these are classified into six botanical varieties and two subspecies (as listed in the peanut scientific classification table). Subspecies A. h. fastigiata types are more upright in their growth habit and have shorter crop cycles. Subspecies A. h. hypogaea types spread more on the ground and have longer crop cycles.[11] The oldest known archeological remains of pods have been dated at about 7,600 years old, possibly a wild species that was in cultivation, or A. hypogaea in the early phase of domestication.[18] They were found in Peru, where dry climatic conditions are favorable for the preservation of organic material. Almost certainly, peanut cultivation predated this at the center of origin where the climate is moister. Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art.[19] Cultivation was well-established in Mesoamerica before the Spanish arrived. There, the conquistadors found the tlālcacahuatl (the plant's Nahuatl name, hence the name in Spanish cacahuate) offered for sale in the marketplace of Tenochtitlan. Its cultivation was introduced in Europe in the 19th century through Spain, particularly Valencia, where it is still produced, albeit marginally.[20] European traders later spread the peanut worldwide, and cultivation is now widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. In West Africa, it substantially replaced a crop plant from the same family, the Bambara groundnut, whose seed pods also develop underground.[21] In China and India, it became an agricultural mainstay, and these countries are the largest producers in the world (Production section). Peanuts were introduced to the US during the colonial period and grown as a garden crop.[22][9] Starting in 1870, they were used as an animal feedstock until human consumption grew in the 1930s.[9] George Washington Carver (1864–1943) championed the peanut as part of his efforts for agricultural extension in the American South, where soils were depleted after repeated plantings of cotton. He invented and promulgated hundreds of peanut-based products, including cosmetics, paints, plastics, gasoline and nitroglycerin.[23] Peanut butter was first manufactured in Canada by a process patented in the US in 1884 by Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Montreal.[24] Peanut butter became well known in the United States after the Beech-Nut company began selling it at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904.[25] The US Department of Agriculture initiated a program to encourage agricultural production and human consumption of peanuts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[9]\n\n### Cultivars In The United States\nThere are many peanut cultivars grown around the world. The market classes grown in the United States are Spanish, Runner, Virginia, and Valencia.[26] Peanuts are produced in three major areas of the US: the southeastern US region which includes Alabama, Georgia, and Florida; the southwestern US region which includes New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; and in the general eastern US which includes Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.[26] In Georgia, Naomi Chapman Woodroof is responsible for developing the breeding program of peanuts, resulting in a harvest almost five times greater.[27] Certain cultivar groups are preferred for particular characteristics, such as differences in flavor, oil content, size, shape, and disease resistance.[28] Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type, along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell. Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy, salted nuts, and peanut butter. The small Spanish types are grown in South Africa and the southwestern and southeastern United States. Until 1940, 90% of the peanuts grown in the US state of Georgia were Spanish types, but the trend since then has been larger-seeded, higher-yielding, more disease-resistant cultivars. Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts. In the US, the Spanish group is primarily grown in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.[26] Cultivars of the Spanish group include 'Dixie Spanish', 'Improved Spanish 2B', 'GFA Spanish', 'Argentine', 'Spantex', 'Spanette', 'Shaffers Spanish', 'Natal Common (Spanish)', \"White Kernel Varieties', 'Starr', 'Comet', 'Florispan', 'Spanhoma', 'Spancross', 'OLin', 'Tamspan 90', 'AT 9899–14', 'Spanco', 'Wilco I', 'GG 2', 'GG 4', 'TMV 2', and 'Tamnut 06'. Since 1940, the southeastern US region has seen a shift to producing Runner group peanuts. This shift is due to good flavor, better roasting characteristics, and higher yields than Spanish types, leading to food manufacturers' preference for the use in peanut butter and salted nuts. Georgia's production is now almost 100% Runner-type.[28] Cultivars of Runners include 'Southeastern Runner 56-15', 'Dixie Runner', 'Early Runner', 'Virginia Bunch 67', 'Bradford Runner', 'Egyptian Giant' (also known as 'Virginia Bunch' and 'Giant'), 'Rhodesian Spanish Bunch' (Va",

In Hawaii they are known as pi pokoliko, 'Puerto Rican pea' or pi nunu, 'pigeon pea' in the Hawaiian language.[45]\n\n### Origin\nThe closest relatives to the cultivated pigeon pea are Cajanus cajanifolia, Cajanus scarabaeoides, and Cajanus kerstingii, native to India and the latter West Africa respectively.[46][47][48] Much debate exist over the geographical origin of the species, with some groups claiming origin from the Nile river and Western Africa, and the other Indian origin.[49] The two epicenters of genetic diversity exist in both Africa and India, but India is considered to be its primary center of origin with West Africa being considered a second major center of origin.[50]\n\n### History\nBy at least 2800 BCE in peninsular India,[51] where its presumptive closest wild relatives Cajanus cajanifolia occurs in tropical deciduous woodlands, its cultivation has been documented.[52] Archaeological finds of pigeon pea cultivation dating to about 14th century BCE have also been found at the Neolithic site of Sanganakallu in Bellary and its border area Tuljapur (where the cultivation of African domesticated plants like pearl millet, finger millet, and Lablab have also been uncovered),[53] as well as in Gopalpur and other South Indian states.[54] From India it may have made its way to North-East Africa via Trans-Oceanic Bronze Age trade that allowed cross-cultural exchange of resources and agricultural products.[55] The earliest evidence of pigeon peas in Africa was found in Ancient Egypt with the presence of seeds in Egyptian tombs dating back to around 2200 BCE.[56] From eastern Africa, cultivation spread further west and south through the continent, where by means of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, it reached the Americas around the 17th century.[39] Pigeon peas were introduced to Hawaii in 1824 by James Macrae with a few specimens becoming naturalized on the islands, but they wouldn't gain much popularity until later.[57] By the early 20th century Filipinos and Puerto Ricans began to emigrate from the American Philippines and Puerto Rico to Hawaii to work in sugarcane plantations in 1906 and 1901, respectively.[58][59][60] Pigeon peas are said to have been popularized on the island by the Puerto Rican community where by the First World War their cultivation began, to expand on the island where they are still cultivated and consumed by locals.[61]\n\n### Nutrition\nPigeon peas contain high levels of protein and the important amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan.[64] The following table indicates completeness of nutritional profile of various amino acids within mature seeds of pigeon pea. Methionine + cystine combination is the only limiting amino acid combination in pigeon pea. In contrast to the mature seeds, the immature seeds are generally lower in all nutritional values, however they contain a significant amount of vitamin C (39 mg per 100 g serving) and have a slightly higher fat content. Research has shown that the protein content of the immature seeds is of a higher quality.[65] Note: All nutrient values including protein and fiber are in %DV per 100 grams of the food item. Significant values are highlighted in light Gray color and bold letters.

Africa is the secondary centre of diversity and at present it contributes about 21% of global production with 1.05 million tons. Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda are the major producers in Africa.[72] Malawi's Nandolo Farmers' Association is supported by international aid via the charity Christian Aid.[73] The pigeon pea is an important legume crop of rainfed agriculture in the semiarid tropics. The Indian subcontinent, Africa and Central America, in that order, are the world's three main pigeon pea-producing regions. Pigeon peas are cultivated in more than 25 tropical and subtropical countries, either as a sole crop or intermixed with cereals, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), or maize (Zea mays), or with other legumes, such as peanuts (Arachis hypogea). Being a legume capable of symbiosis with Rhizobia, the bacteria associated with the pigeon pea enrich soils through symbiotic nitrogen fixation.[74] The crop is cultivated on marginal land by resource-poor farmers, who commonly grow traditional medium- and long-duration (5–11 months) landraces. Short-duration pigeon peas (3–4 months) suitable for multiple cropping have recently been developed. Tradition",

The key ingredient of Dal Maddhra or Maah Da Maddhra dish served in Dogri Dhaam of Jammu is Vigna mungo lentil.[7] Similarly, another dish Teliya Maah popular in Jammu & Kangra uses this lentil.[8] Traditionally, Vigna Mungo Lentil is used for preparing Dogra-style khichdi during Panj Bhikham and Makar Sankranti festival in Jammu and Lower Himachal. Besides, fermented Vigna Mungo paste is also used to prepare Lakhnapuri Bhalle or Lakhanpuri Laddu ( a popular street food of Jammu region). In Uttarakhandi cuisine, Vigna mungo is used for preparing traditional dish called Chainsu or Chaisu. In North Indian cuisine, it is used as an ingredient of Dal makhani, which is a Modern restaurant style adaptation of Traditional Sabut Urad Dal of Northern India. In Bengal, it is used in kalai ruti, biulir dal. In Rajasthan, It is one of the ingredients of Panchmel dal which is usually consumed with bati. In Pakistan, it is called   Dhuli Mash ki daal [9] and used to make laddu Pethi walay and Bhalla. It is also extensively used in South Indian culinary preparations. Black gram is one of the key ingredients in making idli and dosa batter, in which one part of black gram is mixed with three or four parts of idli rice to make the batter. Vada or udid vada also contain black gram and are made from soaked batter and deep-fried in cooking oil. The dough is also used in making papadum, in which white lentils are usually used.

Young stems are purple or green, and mature stems are grayish-yellow or brown. They can be divided into erect cespitose, semi-trailing and trailing types.[9] Wild types tend to be prostrate while cultivated types are more erect.[8] Leaves are ovoid or broad-ovoid, cotyledons die after emergence, and ternate leaves are produced on two single leaves. The leaves are 6–12 cm long and 5–10 cm wide. Racemes with yellow flowers are borne in the axils and tips of the leaves, with 10–25 flowers per pedicel, self-pollinated. The fruits are elongated cylindrical or flat cylindrical pods, usually 30–50 per plant. The pods are 5–10 cm long and 0.4–0.6 cm wide and contain 12–14 septum-separated seeds, which can be either cylindrical or spherical in shape, and green, yellow, brown, or blue in color.[9] Seed colors and presence or absence of a rough layer are used to distinguish different types of mung bean.[8]\n\n### Growth Stages\nGermination is typically within 4–5 days, but the actual rate varies according to the amount of moisture introduced during the germination stage.[10] It is epigeal, with the stem and cotyledons emerging from the seedbed.[11] After germination, the seed splits, and a soft, whitish root grows. Mung bean sprouts are harvested during this stage. If not harvested, it develops a root system, then a green stem which contains two leaves and shoots up from the soil. After that, seed pods begin to form on its branches, with 10–15 seeds contained in each pod.[10] The maturation can take up to 60 days. It can reach up to 76 cm (30 in) tall, with multiple branches with seed pods. Most of the seed pods become darker, while some remain green.[10]\n\n### Similar Species\nVigna radiata is sometimes confused with Vigna mungo (black gram) due to their similar morphology.[12]\n\n### Taxonomy\nMung beans are one of many species moved from the genus Phaseolus to Vigna in the 1970s.[13] The previous names were Phaseolus aureus or P. radiatus. It is a species of Fabaceae and is also known as green gram.[14] There are three subgroups, including one cultivated (V. radiata subsp. radiata) and two wild ones (V. radiata subsp. sublobata and V. radiata subsp. glabra).[8]\n\n### Nitrogen Fixation And Cover Crop\nAs a legume plant, mung bean is in symbiotic association with Rhizobia, which enables it to fix atmospheric nitrogen (58–109 kg per ha mung bean). It can provide large amounts of biomass (7.16 t biomass/ha) and nitrogen to the soil (ranging from 30 to 251 kg/ha).[12] The nitrogen fixation ability not only enables it to meet its own nitrogen requirement, but also benefits the succeeding crops. It can be used as a cover crop before or after cereal crops in rotation, which makes a good green manure.[12]\n\n### Domestication\nThe mung bean was domesticated in India, where its progenitor (Vigna radiata subspecies sublobata) occurs wild.[15][16] 2nd millennium BCE scripture Yajurveda in its 4th chapter refers to mudga (मुद्ग) as one of the important grains and asks Rudra to bless with its good harvest (मु॒द्गाश्च॑ मे॒ खल्वा॑श्च मे) in Rudradhyaya.[17][18] The mung bean is listed as one of the nine auspicious grains (navdhānya) in Vedic astrology and associated with planet Budha (Mercury).[19][20][21] Carbonized mung beans have been discovered in many archeological sites in India.[22] Areas with early finds include the eastern zone of the Harappan civilisation in modern-day Pakistan and western and northwestern India, where finds date back about 4,500 years, and South India in the modern state of Karnataka where finds date back more than 4,000 years. Some scholars, therefore, infer two separate domestications in the northwest and south of India. On the other hand, a recent study suggested a single genetic origin likely contributing to the loss of pod shattering, the key domestication trait in legumes.[23] In South India, there is evidence for the evolution of larger-seeded mung beans 3,500 to 3,000 years ago.[16] By about 3,500 years ago mung beans were widely cultivated throughout India. Cultivated mung beans later spread from India to China and Southeast Asia. Archaeobotanical research at the site of Khao Sam Kaeo in southern Thailand indicates that mung beans had arrived in Thailand by at least 2,200 years ago.[24] A genetic study demonstrated that, following its domestication in South Asia, mung bean spread sequentially to Southeast Asia and East Asia and eventually to Central Asia, despite the geographic proximity of South and Central Asia. The study suggests that the short and dry growing seasons in the northern regions of Asia were not suitable for southern cultivars, which had been bred for extended life cycles to maximize yield. This highlights the critical role of ecological factors, such as climate, in shaping crops evolution.[25]\n\n### Varieties\nThe mung bean varieties now are mainly targeted in resistance to pests and diseases, particularly the bean weevil and mung bean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV). For now, the main varieties include Samrat, IPM2-3, SML 668 and Meha in India; Crystal, Jade-AU, Celera-AU，Satin II，Regur in Australia; Zhonglv No. 1, Zhonglv No. 2, Jilv No. 2, Jilv No. 7, Weilv No. 4, Jihong 9218, Jihong 8937, Bao 876-16, Bao 8824-17 in China. Also, with the help of the World Vegetable Center, the traits of mung bean have been considerably improved.[26][27][28][29] 'Summer Moong' is a short-duration mung bean pulse crop grown in northern India. Due to its short duration, it can fit well in-between of many cropping systems. It is mainly cultivated in East and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is considered to be the hardiest of all pulse crops and requires a hot climate for germination and growth.\n\n### Climate And Soil Requirements\nMung bean is a warm-season and frost-intolerant plant. Mung bean is suitable for being planted in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions. The most suitable temperature for mung bean's germination and growth is 15–18 °C (59–64 °F). Mung bean has high adaptability to various soil types, while the best pH of the soil is between 6.2 and 7.2. Mung bean is a short-day plant and long days will delay its flowering and podding.[30][31]\n\n### Harvest\nThe yield potential of mung bean is around 2.5 to 3.0 t/ha, however, usually due to the resistance to environmental stress and improper management, the average productivity for mung bean is only 0.5 t/ha. Due to the indeterminate flowering habit of mung bean, when facing proper environmental conditions, there can be both flowers and pods in one mung bean plant, which makes it difficult to harvest it. The perfect harvesting stage is when 90% of the pods' colour in one yield has been black. Mung beans can use a harvester for harvesting. It is important to set up the header in case of over-threshing.[32][33]\n\n### Transportation And Storage Condition\nThe perfect moisture of grain for transportation is 13%. Before storage, the cleaning and grading process must be done. The ideal storage condition should keep the mung bean's moisture at exactly 12%.[32][33]\n\n### Pests, Diseases And Abiotic Stress\nMost of the mung bean cultivars have a yield potential of 1.8–2.5 tons/ha. However, the actual average productivity of mung bean hovers around 0.5–0.7 t/ha. Several factors constrain its yield, including biotic stresses (pests and diseases) and abiotic stresses.[34] Stresses not only decrease productivity b",

In a 100-gram reference amount, cooked kidney beans provide 532 kJ (127 kcal) of food energy, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, folate (33% DV), iron (22% DV), and phosphorus (20% DV), with moderate amounts (10–19% DV) of thiamine, copper, magnesium, and zinc (11–14% DV).\n\n### Dishes\nRed kidney beans are used in the cuisine of India, where the beans are known as rajma and Pakistan where they are called surkh lobia. Red kidney beans are commonly used in chili con carne and used in southern Louisiana for the classic Monday Creole dish of red beans and rice. The smaller, darker red beans are also used, particularly in Louisiana families with a recent Caribbean heritage. In Jamaica, they are referred to as red peas. Small kidney beans used in La Rioja, Spain, are called caparrones. In the Netherlands and Indonesia, kidney beans are usually served as a soup called brenebon.[3] In the Levant, a common dish consisting of kidney bean stew usually served with rice is known as fasoulia. To make bean paste, kidney beans are generally prepared from dried beans and boiled until they are soft, at which point the dark red beans are pulverized into a dry paste.\n\n### Toxicity\nRaw red kidney beans contain relatively high amounts of phytohemagglutinin and thus are more toxic than most other bean varieties if not soaked and then boiled for at least 10 minutes. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin.[4] Cooking at the lower temperature of 80 °C (176 °F), such as in a slow cooker, is insufficient to denature the toxin and has been reported to cause food poisoning.[4] As few as five raw beans or a single undercooked kidney bean (as cooking them at insufficient temperatures increases the level of toxic compounds) can cause severe nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pains. Canned red kidney beans, though, are safe to eat straight from the can, as they are cooked prior to being shipped.[5][6][7]",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word vegetable was first recorded in English in the early 15th century. It comes from Old French,[1] and was originally applied to all plants; the word is still used in this sense in biological contexts.[2] It derives from Medieval Latin vegetabilis \"growing, flourishing\" (i.e. of a plant), a semantic change from a Late Latin meaning \"to be enlivening, quickening\".[1] The meaning of \"vegetable\" as a \"plant grown for food\" was not established until the 18th century.[3] In 1767, the word was specifically used to mean a \"plant cultivated for food, an edible herb or root\". The year 1955 saw the first use of the shortened, slang term \"veggie\".[4] As an adjective, the word vegetable is used in scientific and technical contexts with a different and much broader meaning, namely of \"related to plants\" in general, edible or not—as in vegetable matter, vegetable kingdom, vegetable origin, etc.[2]\n\n### Terminology\nThe exact definition of \"vegetable\" may vary simply because of the many parts of a plant consumed as food worldwide—roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. The broadest definition is the word's use adjectivally to mean \"matter of plant origin\". More specifically, a vegetable may be defined as \"any plant, part of which is used for food\",[5] a secondary meaning then being \"the edible part of such a plant\".[5] A more precise definition is \"any plant part consumed for food that is not a fruit or seed, but including mature fruits that are eaten as part of a main meal\".[6][7] Falling outside these definitions are edible fungi (such as edible mushrooms) and edible seaweed which, although not parts of plants, are often treated as vegetables.[8] In the latter-mentioned definition of \"vegetable\", which is used in everyday language, the words \"fruit\" and \"vegetable\" are mutually exclusive. \"Fruit\" has a precise botanical meaning, being a part that developed from the ovary of a flowering plant. This is considerably different from the word's culinary meaning. While peaches, plums, and oranges are \"fruit\" in both senses, many items commonly called \"vegetables\", such as eggplants, bell peppers, and tomatoes, are botanically fruits. The question of whether the tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into the United States Supreme Court in 1893. The court ruled unanimously in Nix v. Hedden that a tomato is correctly identified as, and thus taxed as, a vegetable, for the purposes of the Tariff of 1883 on imported produce. However, the court acknowledged that, botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit.[9]\n\n### History\nBefore the advent of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers and hunted animals for food.[10] Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing is thought to be the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed.[11] While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC.[12] Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.[13] Throughout recorded history, the rich have been able to afford a varied diet including meat, vegetables and fruit, but for poor people, meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull, typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice, rye, barley, wheat, millet or maize. The addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to the diet. The staple diet of the Aztecs in Central America was maize and they cultivated tomatoes, avocados, beans, peppers, pumpkins, squashes, peanuts, and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge. In Peru, the Incas subsisted on maize in the lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes. They also used seeds from quinoa, supplementing their diet with peppers, tomatoes, and avocados.[14] In ancient China, rice was the staple crop in the south and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to accompany these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.[14] The mainstay of the ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils.[15] In ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.[16]\n\n### Nutrition And Health\nVegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling.[18] They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments.[19][20][21] Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.[22]\nThe nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably; some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little fat,[23] and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates. The consumption of crunchy and hard to chew foods, such as raw vegetables, during youth, while the bones are still growing, is needed for the human's, and other animals', jaws' proper development, and without their consumption, the jaws do not grow to their full size, thus not leaving enough room for the teeth to grow in correctly, causing crooked and impacted teeth.[24][25] However, vegetables often also contain toxins and antinutrients which interfere with the absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine,[26] enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, tannins and others.[citation needed] These toxins are natural defenses, used to ward off the insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.[27] Fruit and vegetables, particularly leafy vegetables, have been implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler. Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.[28]\n\n### Recommendations\nThe USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming five to nine servings of fruit and vegetables daily.[30] The total amount consumed wil",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe English word \"potato\" comes from Spanish patata, in turn from Taíno batata, which means \"sweet potato\", not the plant now known as simply \"potato\".[1] The name \"spud\" for a potato is from the 15th century spudde, a short and stout knife or dagger, probably related to Danish spyd, \"spear\". Through semantic change, the general sense of short and thick was transferred to the tuber from around 1840.[2] At least seven languages: Afrikaans, Dutch, Low Saxon, French, (West) Frisian, Hebrew, Persian[3] and some variants of German, use a term for \"potato\" that means \"earth apple\" or \"ground apple\",[4][5] from an earlier sense of both pome and apple, referring in general to a (apple-shaped) fruit or vegetable.[6]\n\n### Description\nPotato plants are herbaceous perennials that grow up to one metre (three feet) high. The stems are hairy. The leaves have roughly four pairs of leaflets. The flowers range from white or pink to blue or purple; they are yellow at the centre, and are insect-pollinated.[7] The plant develops tubers to store nutrients. These are not roots but stems that form from thickened rhizomes at the tips of long thin stolons. On the surface of the tubers there are \"eyes,\" which act as sinks to protect the vegetative buds from which the stems originate. The \"eyes\" are arranged in helical form. In addition, the tubers have small holes that allow breathing, called lenticels. The lenticels are circular and their number varies depending on the size of the tuber and environmental conditions.[8] Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.[9] After flowering, potato plants produce small green fruits that resemble green cherry tomatoes, each containing about 300 very small seeds.[10]\n\n### Phylogeny\nLike the tomato, potatoes belong to the genus Solanum, which is a member of the nightshade family, the Solanaceae. That is a diverse family of flowering plants, often poisonous, that includes the mandrake (Mandragora), deadly nightshade (Atropa), and tobacco (Nicotiana), as shown in the outline phylogenetic tree (many branches omitted). The most commonly cultivated potato is S. tuberosum; there are several other species.[11] many garden flowers and other species Nicotiana (tobacco) Atropa (nightshades) Mandragora (mandrake) (sweet and bell peppers) S. lycopersicum (tomato) S. tuberosum (cultivated potato) The major species grown worldwide is S. tuberosum (a tetraploid with 48 chromosomes), and modern varieties of this species are the most widely cultivated. There are also four diploid species (with 24 chromosomes): S. stenotomum, S. phureja, S. goniocalyx, and S. ajanhuiri. There are two triploid species (with 36 chromosomes): S. chaucha and S. juzepczukii. There is one pentaploid cultivated species (with 60 chromosomes): S. curtilobum.[12] There are two major subspecies of tetraploid S. tuberosum.[12] The Andean potato, S. tuberosum andigena, is adapted to the short-day conditions prevalent in the mountainous equatorial and tropical regions where it originated. The Chilean potato S. tuberosum tuberosum, native to the Chiloé Archipelago, is in contrast adapted to the long-day conditions prevalent in the higher latitude region of southern Chile.[13] A 2025 study by Zhang et al. examining Solanum genomes groups all species of potato under S. tuberosum.[14] According to the study, the Petota (potato) lineage contains more than 55 diploid species, with only one being selected by humans for domestication; the study posits that all landraces branch out from a single point within Solanum candolleanum.[14]\n\n### Domestication\nWild potato species occur from the southern United States to southern Chile.[15] The potato was first domesticated in southern Peru and northwestern Bolivia[16] by pre-Columbian farmers, around Lake Titicaca.[17] Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000–10,000 years ago from a species in the S. brevicaule complex.[16][17][18] The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Ancon (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC.[19][20] The most widely cultivated variety, Solanum tuberosum tuberosum, is indigenous to the Chiloé Archipelago, and has been cultivated by the local indigenous people since before the Spanish conquest.[13][21]\n\n### Spread\nFollowing the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century as part of the Columbian exchange. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners (possibly including the Russian-American Company) to territories and ports throughout the world, especially their colonies.[22] European and colonial farmers were slow to adopt farming potatoes. However, after 1750, they became an important food staple and field crop[22] and played a major role in the European 19th century population boom.[18] According to conservative estimates, the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900.[23] However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora infestans, spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland as well as parts of the Scottish Highlands, resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine.[24][22] The International Potato Center, based in Lima, Peru, holds 4,870 types of potato germplasm, most of which are traditional landrace cultivars.[25] In 2009, a draft sequence of the potato genome was made, containing 12 chromosomes and 860 million base pairs, making it a medium-sized plant genome.[26] It had been thought that most potato cultivars derived from a single origin in southern Peru and extreme Northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the S. brevicaule complex.[16][17][18] DNA analysis however shows that more than 99% of all current varieties of potatoes are direct descendants of a subspecies that once grew in the lowlands of south-central Chile.[27] Most modern potatoes grown in North America arrived through European settlement and not independently from the South American sources. At least one wild potato species, S. fendleri, occurs in North America; it is used in breeding for resistance to a nematode species that attacks cultivated potatoes. A secondary center of genetic variability of the potato is Mexico, where important wild species that have been used extensively in modern breeding are found, such as the hexaploid S. demissum, used as a source of resistance to the devastating late blight disease (Phytophthora infestans).[24] Another relative native to this region, Solanum bulbocastanum, has been used to genetically engineer the potato to resist potato blight.[28]  Many such wild relatives are useful for breeding resistance to P. infestans.[29] Little of the diversity found in Solanum ancestral and wild relatives is found outside the original South American range.[30] This makes these South American species highly valuable in breeding.[30] The importance of the potato to humanity is recognised in the United Nations International Day of Potato, to be celebrated on 30 May each year, starting in 2024.[31]\n\n### Breeding\nPotatoes, both S. tuberosum and most of its wild relatives, are self-incompatible: they bear no useful fruit when self-pollinated. This trait is problematic for crop breeding, as all sexually produced plants must be hybrids. The gene responsible for self-incompatibility, as well as mutations to disable it, are now known. Self-compatibility has successfully been introduced both to diploid potatoes (including a special line of S. tuberosum) by CRISPR-Cas9.[32] Plants having a 'Sli' gene produce pollen which is compatible to its own parent and plants with similar S genes.[33] This gene was cloned",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word tomato comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl [ˈtomat͡ɬ] pronunciationⓘ.[2] The specific name lycopersicum, meaning 'wolf peach', originated with Galen, who used it to denote a plant that has never been identified. Luigi Anguillara speculated in the 16th century that Galen's lycopersicum might be the tomato, and despite the impossibility of this identification, lycopersicum entered scientific use as a name for the fruit.[3]\n\n### Pronunciation\nThe usual pronunciations of tomato are /təˈmeɪtoʊ/  (in North American English) and /təˈmɑːtoʊ/ (in British English).[4] The word's dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin's 1937 song \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" (\"You like /pəˈteɪtoʊ/ and I like /pəˈtɑːtoʊ/ / You like /təˈmeɪtoʊ/ and I like /təˈmɑːtoʊ/\").[5]\n\n### History\nThe likely wild ancestor of the tomato, the red-fruited Solanum pimpinellifolium, is native to western South America, where it was probably first domesticated. The resulting domesticated plant, ancestral to the modern large-fruited tomato varieties, was probably the cherry tomato, S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme.[6][7] However, genomic analysis suggests that the domestication process may have been more complex than this. S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme may have existed before domestication, while traits supposedly typical of domestication may have been reduced in that variety and then reselected (in a case of convergent evolution) in the cultivated tomato. The analysis predicts that var. cerasiforme appeared around 78,000 years ago, while the cultivated tomato originated around 7,000 years ago (5,000 BCE), with substantial uncertainty, making it unclear how humans may have been involved in the process.[8] The Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish food. Elsewhere in Europe, its first use was ornamental, not least because it was understood to be related to the nightshades and assumed to be poisonous.[9]\n\n### Mesoamerica\nThe exact date of domestication is unknown; by 500 BCE, it was already being cultivated in southern Mexico and probably other areas.[10] The Pueblo people believed that tomato seeds could confer powers of divination. The large, lumpy variety of tomato, a mutation from a smoother, smaller fruit, originated in Mesoamerica, and may be the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes.[11] The Aztecs raised several varieties of tomato, with red tomatoes called xitomatl.[12] Bernardino de Sahagún reported seeing a great variety of tomatoes in the Aztec market at Tenochtitlán (Mexico City): \"large tomatoes, small tomatoes, leaf tomatoes, sweet tomatoes, large serpent tomatoes, nipple-shaped tomatoes\", and tomatoes of all colors from the brightest red to the deepest yellow.[13] Sahagún mentioned Aztecs cooking various sauces, some with tomatoes of different sizes, serving them in city markets: \"foods sauces, hot sauces; ... with tomatoes, ... sauce of large tomatoes, sauce of ordinary tomatoes, ...\"[14]\n\n### Spanish Distribution\nThe Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés's capture of Tenochtitlan in 1521 initiated the widespread cultural and biological interchange called the Columbian exchange; certainly the tomato was being grown in Europe within a few years of that event.[15] The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in Pietro Andrea Mattioli's 1544 herbal. He suggested that a new type of eggplant had been brought to Italy. He stated that it was blood red or golden color when mature, and could be divided into segments and eaten like an eggplant—that is, cooked and seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oil. Ten years later Mattioli named the fruits in print as pomi d'oro, or \"golden apples\".[10] After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean. They brought it to the Philippines, from where it spread to southeast Asia and then the whole of Asia.[16]\nThe Spanish brought the tomato to Europe, where it grew easily in Mediterranean climates; cultivation began in the 1540s. It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in Spain, as documented in the 1618 play La octava maravilla by Lope de Vega with \"lovelier than ... a tomato in season\".[15]\n\n### China\nThe tomato was introduced to China, likely via the Philippines or Macau, in the 16th century. It was given the name 番茄 fānqié (foreign eggplant), as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from abroad, but referring specifically to early introductions.[17]\n\n### Italy\nIn 1548, the house steward of  Cosimo de' Medici, the grand duke of Tuscany, wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke's Florentine estate at Torre del Gallo \"had arrived safely\".[18] Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy. For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\", and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. The tomato's ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy. However, in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of growing close to the ground suggested low status. They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other crops. Additionally, both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any other varieties.[19] In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration, until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century.[20] The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.[21] Varieties were developed over the following centuries for drying, for sauce, for pizzas, and for long-term storage. These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name. For example, there is the Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, the \"hanging tomato of Vesuvius\", and the well known and highly prized San Marzano tomato grown in that region, with a European protected designation of origin certification.[22]\n\n### Britain\nTomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s. One of the earliest cultivators was John Gerard, a barber-surgeon. Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental sources, is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England. Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy. Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous. Gerard's views were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating for many years in Britain and its North American colonies.[21] By 1820, tomatoes were described as \"to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets\" and to be \"used by all our best cooks\", reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still \"for the singularity of their appearance\", while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine.[23] For example, in Elizabeth Blackwell's A Curious Herbal, it is described under the name \"Love Apple (Amoris Pomum)\" as being consumed with oil and vinegar in Italy, similar to consumption of cucumbers in the UK.[24] In 1963, The New York Times gave an explanation of the name 'Love Apple' as a French misreading of the Italian pomo dei Mori (\"the Moors' apple\") as pomme d'amour, (\"apple of love\").[25]\n\n### Middle East\nThe tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker, British consul in Aleppo c. 1799 to 1825.[26][27][28] Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an ingredient in a cooked dish. In 1881, it is described",

    "content": "### Taxonomy And Etymology\nThe onion plant (Allium cepa), also known as the bulb onion[2] or common onion,[3] is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium.[4][5] It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum.[6] Synonyms during its taxonomic history are:[7][8] A. cepa is known exclusively from cultivation,[9] but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran. The most closely related include A. vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A. asarense from Iran.[10][11] The genus Allium contains other species variously called onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (A. fistulosum), Egyptian onion (A.  × proliferum), and Canada onion (A. canadense).[3] The vast majority of cultivars of A. cepa belong to the common onion group (A. cepa var. cepa) and are usually referred to simply as onions. The Aggregatum Group of cultivars (A. cepa var. aggregatum) includes both shallots,[12] formerly classed as a separate species,[13][14] and potato onions.[12] Related species include garlic, leek, and chives.[15] Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for \"onion\"; the generic name Allium is the classical Latin name for garlic.[16] \nIt has an affinity with  Spanish: cebolla, Italian: cipolla, Polish: cebula, and the German Zwiebel (this last altered by folk etymology). The English word \"chive\" is from the Old French chive , in turn from cepa.[17]\n\n### Description\nThe onion is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in). The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper to blunt tips. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb. From the underside of the plate, a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases, and the bulb of the onion swells.[18] In the autumn, the leaves die back, and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is normally harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear, and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross-section.[18] The average pH of an onion is around 5.5.[19]\n\n### History\nHumans have grown and selectively bred onions in cultivation for at least 7,000 years.[20] The geographic origin of the onion is uncertain; ancient records of onion use span both eastern and western Asia.[21][22] Domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia.[12][23] Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran, western Pakistan and Central Asia.[21][23]: 1 [22][24] The onion species Allium fistulosum (spring onion, bunching onion) and Allium tuberosum (Chinese leek) were domesticated in China around 6000 BC alongside other vegetables, grains, and fruits.[25] Recipes using onions and other Allium species were recorded in cuneiform script on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia, around 2000 BC; the tablets are held in Yale University's Babylonian collection.[26] The Assyriologist and \"gourmet cook\"[26] Jean Bottero stated this was \"a cuisine of striking richness, refinement, sophistication and artistry\".[26] The onion is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible; evidence of onions in ancient Israel comes from Chalcolithic Nahal Mishmar and from Bronze Age Jericho.[27] Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb, viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life.[23] Onions were used in Egyptian burials, as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV.[28] Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii. He documented Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve ocular ailments, aid in sleep, and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites, lumbago, and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Pliny's detailed narratives. According to texts collected in the fifth/sixth century AD under the authorial aegis of \"Apicius\" (said to have been a gourmet), onions were used in many Roman recipes.[23] In the Age of Discovery, onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers in part of the Columbian exchange. They found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy.[21] According to diaries kept by some of the first English colonists, the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted in North America by the Pilgrim fathers.[23] Between 1883 and 1939, inventors in the United States patented 97 inventions meant to make onion-growing more efficient through automation.[29]\n\n### Culinary\nThree colour varieties of onions offer different possibilities for the cook: While the large, mature onion bulb is most often eaten, onions can be eaten at immature stages. Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions. When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun, but the onion is not yet mature, the plants are sometimes referred to as \"summer\" onions. Onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes, known as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions; these are not true pearl onions which are a different species.[32] Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient, while pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.[33] Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a side serving with traditional pub food such as a ploughman's lunch.[34] Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may be used as a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup, creamed onions, and onion chutney. They are versatile and can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, sautéed, or eaten raw in salads.[35] Onions are a major ingredient of some curries; the Persian-style dopiaza's name means \"double onion\", and it is used both in the dish's sour curry sauce and as a garnish.[36] Onion powder is a seasoning made from finely ground, dehydrated onions; it is often included in seasoned salt and spice mixes.[37]\n\n### Other Uses\nOnions have particularly large cells that are easy to observe under low magnification. Forming a single layer of cells, the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational, experimental, and breeding purposes.[38][39] Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure.[40] Onion skins can be boiled to make an orange-brown dye.[41]\n\n### Nutrients\nMost onion cultivars are about 89% water, 9% carbohydrates (including 4% sugar and 2% dietary fibre), 1% protein, and negligible fat (table). Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ (40 kilocalories) in a 100 g (3.5 oz) amount. Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content.[23]\n\n### Phytochemicals\nOnion varieties vary widely in phytochemical content, particularly for polyphenols, with shallots having the highest level, six times the amount found in Vidalia onions. Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content, an amount 11 times higher than in white onions. Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments, with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10% of total flavonoid content.[44] Like garlic,[45] onions ca",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe word is first recorded in English around 1530 and was borrowed from the Middle French carotte, itself from the Late Latin carōta, from the ancient Greek καρωτόν (karōtón), originally from the Proto-Indo-European root *ker- ('horn'), due to its horn-like shape.[3] In Old English, carrots (typically white at the time) were not clearly distinguished from parsnips.[3] The word's use as a colour name in English was first recorded around 1670, originally referring to yellowish-red hair.[3]\n\n### Description\nDaucus carota is a biennial plant. In the first year, energy is stored in the taproot to enable the plant to flower in its second year.[4] Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between taproot and stem: the stem is thicker and lacks lateral roots. At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf. The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days after germination. Subsequent leaves are alternate (with a single leaf attached to a node), spirally arranged, and pinnately compound, with leaf bases sheathing the stem. As the plant grows, the bases of the seed leaves, near the taproot, are pushed apart. The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates for flowering, the tip of the stem narrows and becomes pointed, and the stem extends upward to become a highly branched inflorescence up to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.[5] Most of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem). High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core. Although a carrot completely lacking xylem is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity. Taproots are typically long and conical, although cylindrical and nearly spherical cultivars are available. The root diameter can range from 1 cm (3⁄8 in) to as much as 10 cm (4 in) at the widest part. The root length ranges from 5 to 50 cm (2 to 20 in), although most are between 10 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in).[5] Flower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels.[5] A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.[5] Flowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive. The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels.[5] The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.[5] The fruit that develops is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.[5] The carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18).[6][7] The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome.[8]\n\n### Chemistry\nPolyacetylenes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like carrots where they show cytotoxic activities.[9][10] Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol)[11] are such compounds. This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides.[11] Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.[12] Other compounds include pyrrolidine present in the leaves[13] and 6-hydroxymellein.[14]\n\n### Taxonomy\nBoth written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia.[6][7] Its wild ancestors probably originated in Greater Iran (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.[15][16]\n\n### History\nWhen first cultivated, carrots were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds have been found in Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC.[17] Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, coriander (cilantro), fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century AD;[18] the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca,[19] which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.[20][21] The plant is depicted and described in the Eastern Roman Juliana Anicia Codex, a 6th-century AD Constantinopolitan copy of the Greek physician Dioscorides' 1st-century pharmacopoeia of herbs and medicines, De Materia Medica. The text states that \"the root can be cooked and eaten\".[22] Another copy of this work, Codex Neapolitanes from the late 6th or early 7th century, has basically the same illustrations but with roots in purple.[23] The plant was introduced into Spain by the Moors in the 8th century.[24] In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe were purple.[25] The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this time.[18] The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both red and yellow carrots,[26] as does the 12th-century Arab-Andalusian agriculturist, Ibn al-'Awwam.[27] Cultivated carrots appeared in China in the 12th century,[28] and in Japan in the 16th or 17th century.[29] The orange carrot was created by Dutch growers. There is pictorial evidence that the orange carrot existed at least in 512 AD, but it is probable that it was not a stable variety until the Dutch bred the cultivar termed the \"Long Orange\" at the start of the 18th century.[30] Some claim that the Dutch created the orange carrots to honor the Dutch flag at the time and William of Ora",

    "content": "### Description\nCabbage seedlings have a thin taproot and cordate (heart-shaped) cotyledons. The first leaves produced are ovate (egg-shaped) with a lobed petiole. Plants are 40–60 centimetres (15+1⁄2–23+1⁄2 inches) tall in their first year at the mature vegetative stage, and 1.5–2 metres (5–6+1⁄2 feet) tall when flowering in the second year.[6] Heads average between 0.5 and 4 kilograms (1 and 8 pounds), with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads.[7] Most cabbages have thick, alternating leaves, with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected; some varieties have a waxy bloom on the leaves. Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow.[8] About 90% of the root mass is in the upper 20–30 cm (8–12 in) of soil; some lateral roots can penetrate up to 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) deep.[6] The inflorescence is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring 50–100 cm (20–40 in) tall,[6] with flowers that are yellow or white. Each flower has four petals set in a perpendicular pattern, as well as four sepals, six stamens, and a superior ovary that is two-celled and contains a single stigma and style. Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments. The fruit is a silique that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape. Self-pollination is impossible, and plants are cross-pollinated by insects.[8] The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves, each measuring 25–35 cm (10–14 in) by 20–30 cm (8–12 in);[6] after this, leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through the leaves cupping inward.[9] Many shapes, colors and leaf textures are found in various cultivated varieties of cabbage. Leaf types are generally divided between crinkled-leaf, loose-head savoys and smooth-leaf firm-head cabbages, while the color spectrum includes white and a range of greens and purples. Oblate, round and pointed shapes are found.[10] Cabbage has been selectively bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The appearance of the cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics.[11] Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage.[12] Scientific research into the genetic modification of B. oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance.[13] There are several Guinness Book of World Records entries related to cabbage. These include the heaviest cabbage, at 62.71 kg (138 lb 4 oz),[14] heaviest red cabbage, at 31.6 kilograms (69 lb 11 oz),[15] longest cabbage roll, at 19.54 m (64 ft),[16] and the largest cabbage dish, at 2,960 kg (6,526 lb).[17]\n\n### Taxonomy\nCabbage (Brassica oleracea or B. oleracea var. capitata,[18] var. tuba, var. sabauda[9] or var. acephala)[19] is a member of the genus Brassica and the mustard family Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous vegetables (sometimes known as cole crops[9]) are cultivars of B. oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild cabbage B. oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.[18] \"Cabbage\" was originally used to refer to multiple forms of B. oleracea, including those with loose or non-existent heads.[20] A related species, Brassica rapa, is commonly named Chinese, napa or celery cabbage, and has many of the same uses.[21] It is also a part of common names for several unrelated species. These include cabbage bark or cabbage tree (a member of the genus Andira) and cabbage palms, which include several genera of palms such as Mauritia, Roystonea oleracea, Acrocomia and Euterpe oenocarpus.[22][23]\n\n### Etymology\nThe original family name of brassicas was Cruciferae, which derived from the flower petal pattern thought by medieval Europeans to resemble a crucifix.[8] The word brassica derives from bresic, a Celtic word for cabbage.[20] The varietal epithet capitata is derived from the Latin word for 'having a head'.[24] Many European and Asiatic names for cabbage are derived from the Celto-Slavic root cap or kap, meaning \"head\".[25] The late Middle English word cabbage derives from the word caboche (\"head\"), from the Picard dialect of Old French. This in turn is a variant of the Old French caboce.[26]\n\n### History\nAlthough cabbage has an extensive history,[1] it is difficult to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as \"brassicas\".[27] A possible wild ancestor of cabbage, Brassica oleracea, originally found in Britain and continental Europe, is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats,[28] retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened, turgid leaves. However, genetic analysis is consistent with feral origin of this population, deriving from plants escaped from field and gardens.[29] According to the triangle of U theory of the evolution and relationships between Brassica species, B. oleracea and other closely related kale vegetables (cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated.[30] Cabbage was probably domesticated later in history than Near Eastern crops such as lentils and summer wheat. Because of the wide range of crops developed from the wild B. oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC,[31] perhaps by the Celts of central and western Europe,[20] although recent linguistic and genetic evidence enforces a Mediterranean origin of cultivated brassicas.[32] While unidentified brassicas were part of the highly conservative unchanging Mesopotamian garden repertory,[33] it is believed that the ancient Egyptians did not cultivate cabbage,[34] which is not native to the Nile valley, though the word shaw't in Papyrus Harris of the time of Ramesses III has been interpreted as \"cabbage\".[35] The ancient Greeks had some varieties of cabbage, as mentioned by Theophrastus, although whether they were more closely related to today's cabbage or to one of the other Brassica crops is unknown.[31] The headed cabbage variety was known to the Greeks as krambe and to the Romans as brassica or olus;[36] the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as raphanos and in Latin as caulis.[36] Ptolemaic Egyptians knew the cole crops as gramb, under the influence of Greek krambe, which had been a familiar plant to the Macedonian antecedents of the Ptolemies.[35] By early Roman times, Egyptian artisans and children were eating cabbage and turnips among a wide variety of other vegetables and pulses.[37] Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a treatise on cabbage, which Pliny knew,[38] but it has not survived. The Greeks were convinced that cabbages and grapevines were inimical, and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.[39] Brassica was considered by some Romans a table luxury,[40] although Lucullus considered it unfit for the senatorial table.[41] The more traditionalist Cato the Elder, espousing a simple Republican life, ate his cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar; he said it surpassed all other vegetables, and approvingly distinguished three varieties; he also gave direc",

    "content": "### Description\nThere are four major groups of cauliflower.[2]\n\n### Domestication\nCauliflowers are an \"arrested inflorescence\" subspecies of B. oleracea that arose around 2,500 years ago.[4] Genomic analysis finds initially evolved from broccoli with three MADS-box genes, playing roles in its curd formation. Nine loci and candidate genes are linked with morphological and biological characters.[4]\n\n### Varieties\nThere are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world. A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.[5]\n\n### Phytochemicals\nCauliflower contains several non-nutrient phytochemicals common in the cabbage family that are under preliminary research for their potential properties, including isothiocyanates and glucosinolates.[9] Boiling reduces the levels of cauliflower glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.[10]\n\n### Etymology\nThe word \"cauliflower\" derives from the Italian cavolfiore, meaning \"cabbage flower\".[11] The ultimate origin of the name is from the Latin words caulis (cabbage) and flōs (flower).[12]\n\n### Nutrition\nRaw cauliflower is 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5 oz), raw cauliflower provides 25 calories of food energy, and has a high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (54% DV) and moderate levels of several B vitamins, vitamin K, and potassium (10–14% DV; table). Contents of other micronutrients are low (below 5% DV).\n\n### History\nCauliflower is the result of selective breeding and likely arose in the Mediterranean region, possibly from broccoli.[15] Pliny the Elder  included cyma among cultivated plants he described in Natural History: \"Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma\"[16] (\"Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is cyma\").[17] Pliny's description likely refers to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of Brassica oleracea.[18] In the Middle Ages, early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the 12th- and 13th-century Arab botanists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar claiming its origin to be Cyprus.[19][20] This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus colewort, and there was extensive trade in Western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the 16th century.[21] It is thought to have been introduced into Italy from Cyprus or the east coast of the Mediterranean around 1490 and then spread to other European countries in the following centuries.[15] François Pierre La Varenne employed chouxfleurs in Le cuisinier françois.[22] They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century and are featured in Olivier de Serres' Théâtre de l'agriculture (1600), as cauli-fiori \"as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy\",[23] but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV.[24] It was introduced to India in 1822 by the British.[25]\n\n### Horticulture\nCauliflower is relatively difficult to grow compared to cabbage, with common problems such as an underdeveloped head and poor curd quality.[26] Because the weather is a limiting factor for producing cauliflower, the plant grows best in moderate daytime temperatures 21–29 °C (70–85 °F), with plentiful sun and moist soil conditions high in organic matter and sandy soils.[6] The earliest maturity possible for cauliflower is 7 to 12 weeks from transplanting.[26] In the northern hemisphere, fall season plantings in July may enable harvesting before autumn frost.[6] Long periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue.[6] Transplantable cauliflowers can be produced in containers such as flats, hotbeds, or fields. In soil that is loose, well-drained, and fertile, field seedlings are shallow-planted 1 cm (1⁄2 in) and thinned by ample space – about 12 plants per 30 cm (1 ft).[6] Ideal growing temperatures are about 18 °C (65 °F) when seedlings are 25 to 35 days old.[6] Applications of fertilizer to developing seedlings begin when leaves appear, usually with a starter solution weekly. Transplanting to the field normally begins in late spring and may continue until mid-summer. Row spacing is about 38–46 cm (15–18 in).\nRapid vegetative growth after transplanting may benefit from such procedures as avoiding spring frosts, using starter solutions high in phosphorus, irrigating weekly, and applying fertilizer.[6] The most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem, stunted head growth or buttoning, ricing, browning, and leaf-tip burn.[6] Among major pests affecting cauliflower are aphids, root maggots, cutworms, moths, and flea beetles.[26] The plant is susceptible to black rot, black leg, club root, black leaf spot, and downy mildew.[6] When cauliflower is mature, heads appear clear white, compact, and 15–20 cm (6–8 in) in diameter, and should be cooled shortly after harvest.[6] Forced air cooling to remove heat from the field during hot weather may be needed for optimal preservation. Short-term storage is possible using cool, high-humidity storage conditions.[6] Many species of blowflies, including Calliphora vomitoria, are known pollinators of cauliflower.[27]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of cauliflower (combined for production reports with broccoli) was 26.5 million tonnes, led by China and India which had 72% of the total (table). Secondary producers were the United States, Spain, and Mexico.\n\n### Culinary\nCauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw. When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible \"curd\" or \"head\"). The leaves are also edible but are often discarded.[29] Cauliflower can be used as a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to rice and flour. Between 2012 and 2016, cauliflower production in the United States increased by 63%, and cauliflower-based product sales increased by 71% between 2017 and 2018. Cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets and cooking the result in oil.[30][31] Cauliflower pizza crust is made from cauliflower flour.[32] Mashed cauliflower is a low-carbohydrate alternative to mashed potatoes.[33]\n\n### In Culture\nCauliflower has been noticed by mathematicians for its distinct fractal dimension,[34][35] calculated to be roughly 2.8.[36][37] One of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch, or \"module\", is similar to the entire cauliflower. Another quality, also present in other plant species, is that the angle between \"modules\", as they become more distant from the center, is 360 degrees divided by the golden ratio.[38] The fancied resemblance of the shape of a boxer's ear to a cauliflower gave rise to the term \"cauliflower ear\".",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe English word \"spinach\" dates to the late 14th century from the Old French word espinache.[2] The name entered European languages from medieval Latin spinagium, which borrowed it from Andalusian Arabic, isbinakh. That in turn derives from Persian aspānāḵ.[3][2]\n\n### Taxonomy\nCommon spinach (S. oleracea) was long considered to be in the family Chenopodiaceae, but in 2003 that family was merged into the Amaranthaceae in the order Caryophyllales.[4][5] Within the family Amaranthaceae sensu lato, Spinach belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae.[6]\n\n### Description\nAs opposed to most flowering plants used as vegetables, spinach is a dioecious plant, meaning different plants can have either female or male flowers.[a][7]\nThe flowers are small, green and wind pollinated.\n\n### History\nSpinach is thought to have originated about 2,000 years ago in ancient Persia from which it was introduced to India and later to ancient China via Nepal in 647 CE as the \"Persian vegetable\".[8] In 827 CE, the Arabs introduced spinach to Sicily.[9] The first written evidence of spinach in the Mediterranean was recorded in three 10th-century works: a medical work by al-Rāzī (known as Rhazes in the West) and in two agricultural treatises, one by Ibn Waḥshīyah and the other by Qusṭus al-Rūmī. Spinach became a popular vegetable in the Arab Mediterranean and arrived in the Iberian Peninsula by the latter part of the 12th century, where Ibn al-ʻAwwām called it raʼīs al-buqūl, 'the chieftain of leafy greens'.[10] Spinach was also the subject of a special treatise in the 11th century by Ibn Ḥajjāj.[11][better source needed] Spinach first appeared in England and France in the 14th century,  probably via Iberia, and gained common use because it appeared in early spring when fresh local vegetables were not available.[8] Spinach is mentioned in the first known English cookbook, the Forme of Cury (1390), where it is referred to as 'spinnedge' and 'spynoches'.[8][12] During World War I, wine fortified with spinach juice was given to injured French soldiers with the intent to curtail their bleeding.[8][13]\n\n### Nutrients\nRaw spinach is 91% water, 4% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving providing 97 kilojoules (23 kilocalories) of food energy, spinach has a high nutritional value, especially when fresh, frozen, steamed, or quickly boiled. It is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, manganese, and folate (31-52% DV), with an especially high content of vitamin K (403% DV) (table). Spinach is a moderate source (10–19% of DV) of the B vitamins, riboflavin and vitamin B6, vitamin E, potassium, iron, magnesium, and dietary fiber (table). Although spinach contains moderate amounts of iron and calcium, it also contains oxalates, which may inhibit absorption of calcium and iron in the stomach and small intestine. Cooked spinach has lower levels of oxalates, and its nutrients may be absorbed more completely.[16][17] Cooking spinach significantly decreases its vitamin C concentration, as vitamin C is degraded by heating. Folate levels may also be decreased, as folate tends to leach into cooking liquid.[18] Spinach is rich in nitrates and nitrites, which may exceed safe levels if spinach is over-consumed.[19]\n\n### Cuisine\nSpinach is eaten raw, in salads, and cooked in soups, curries, or casseroles. Dishes with spinach as a main ingredient include spinach salad, spinach soup, spinach dip, saag paneer, pkhali, ispanakhi matsvnit, and spanakopita. In classical French cuisine, a spinach-based dish may be described as à la Florentine.[20]\n\n### Production\nIn 2022, world production of spinach was 33 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 93% of the total.[1]\n\n### Marketing And Safety\nFresh spinach is sold loose, bunched, or packaged fresh in bags. Fresh spinach loses much of its nutritional value with storage of more than a few days.[21] Fresh spinach is packaged in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, fresh spinach loses most of its folate and carotenoid content over this period of time. For longer storage, it is canned, or blanched or cooked and frozen.[21] Some packaged spinach is exposed to radiation to kill any harmful bacteria. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to an absorbed dose of 4.0 kilograys, having no or only a minor effect on nutrient content.[22] Spinach may be high in cadmium contamination depending on the soil and location where the spinach is grown.[23] Due to spinach's high content of vitamin K, individuals taking the anticoagulant warfarin, which acts by inhibiting vitamin K, are instructed to minimize consumption of spinach (and other dark green leafy vegetables).[24]\n\n### In Popular Culture\nThe comics and cartoon character Popeye the Sailor Man is portrayed as gaining strength by consuming canned spinach.[27] The accompanying song lyric is: \"I'm strong to the finich  [sic], 'cuz I eats me spinach.\"[28] This is usually attributed to the iron content of spinach, but in a 1932 strip, Popeye states that \"spinach is full of vitamin A\" and that is what makes people strong and healthy.[29] As it happens, spinach is not a better source of dietary iron than many other vegetables. The false idea that spinach is an especially good source of dietary iron is an academic urban legend.[30]",

    "content": "### Description\nThe eggplant is a delicate, tropical perennial plant often cultivated as a tender or half-hardy annual in temperate climates. The stem is often spiny. It grows 40 to 150 cm (1 ft 4 in to 4 ft 11 in) tall,[9] with large, coarsely lobed leaves that are 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) long and 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) broad.[10] Semiwild types can grow much larger, to 225 cm (7 ft 5 in), with large leaves over 30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (6 in) broad.[11] The flowers are white to purple in color, with a five-lobed corolla and yellow stamens.[12] Botanically classified as a berry, the fruit contains numerous small, soft, edible seeds that taste bitter because they contain or are covered in nicotinoid alkaloids, like the related tobacco.[13] Some common cultivars have fruit that is egg-shaped, glossy, and purple with white flesh and a spongy, \"meaty\" texture. Some other cultivars are white and longer in shape. Wild eggplants fruits measure less than 3 cm (1+1⁄4 in) in diameter.[11] The fruit flesh rapidly turns brown when in contact with the oxygen in the air.[14]\n\n### Genetics\nThe eggplant genome has 12 chromosomes.[15]\n\n### Etymology And Regional Names\nThe plant and fruit have a profusion of English names.\n\n### Eggplant-Type Names\nThe name eggplant is usual in North American English and Australian English. First recorded in 1763, the word \"eggplant\" was originally applied to white cultivars, which look very much like hen's eggs (see image).[16][17][18] Similar names are widespread in other languages, such as the Icelandic term eggaldin or the Welsh planhigyn ŵy. The white, egg-shaped varieties of the eggplant's fruits are also known as garden eggs,[19] a term first attested in 1811.[20] The Oxford English Dictionary records that between 1797 and 1888, the name vegetable egg was also used.[21]\n\n### Aubergine-Type Names\nWhereas eggplant was coined in some variations English, any other European names for the plant derive from the Arabic: باذنجان bāḏinjān [bæːðɪnˈd͡ʒæːn] listenⓘ.[22] Bāḏinjān is itself a loan-word in Arabic, whose earliest traceable origins lie in the Dravidian languages. The Hobson-Jobson dictionary comments that \"probably there is no word of the kind which has undergone such extraordinary variety of modifications, whilst retaining the same meaning, as this\".[23] In English usage, modern names deriving from Arabic bāḏinjān include: All the aubergine-type names have the same origin, in the Dravidian languages. Modern descendants of this ancient Dravidian word include Malayalam vaṟutina and Tamil vaṟutuṇai.[22] The Dravidian word was borrowed into the Indo-Aryan languages, giving ancient forms such as Sanskrit and Pali vātiṅ-gaṇa (alongside Sanskrit vātigama) and Prakrit vāiṃaṇa. According to the entry brinjal in the Oxford English Dictionary, the Sanskrit word vātin-gāna denoted 'the class (that removes) the wind-disorder (windy humour)': that is, vātin-gāna came to be the name for eggplants because they were thought to cure flatulence. The modern Hindustani words descending directly from the Sanskrit name are baingan and began.[25] The Indic word vātiṅ-gaṇa was then borrowed into Persian as bādingān. Persian bādingān was borrowed in turn into Arabic as bāḏinjān (or, with the definite article, al-bāḏinjān). From Arabic, the word was borrowed into European languages.[22] In al-Andalus, the Arabic word (al-)bāḏinjān was borrowed into the Romance languages in forms beginning with b- or, with the definite article included, alb-:[22] The Spanish word alberenjena was then borrowed into French, giving aubergine (along with French dialectal forms like albergine, albergaine, albergame, and belingèle). The French name was then borrowed into British English, appearing there first in the late eighteenth century.[22] Through the colonial expansion of Portugal, the Portuguese form bringella was borrowed into a variety of other languages:[22] Thus although Indian English brinjal ultimately originates in languages of the Indian Subcontinent, it actually came into Indian English via Portuguese. The Arabic word bāḏinjān was borrowed into Greek by the eleventh century CE. The Greek loans took a variety of forms, but crucially they began with m-, partly because Greek lacked the initial b- sound and partly through folk-etymological association with the Greek word μέλας (melas), 'black'. Attested Greek forms include ματιζάνιον (matizanion, eleventh-century), μελιντζάνα (melintzana, fourteenth-century), and μελιντζάνιον (melintzanion, seventeenth-century).[22] From Greek, the word was borrowed into Italian and medieval Latin, and onwards into French. Early forms include:[22] From these forms came the botanical Latin melongēna. This was used by Tournefort as a genus name in 1700, then by Linnaeus as a species name in 1753. It remains in scientific use.[22] These forms also gave rise to the Caribbean English melongene.[22] The Italian melanzana, through folk-etymology, was adapted to mela insana ('mad apple'): already by the thirteenth century, this name had given rise to a tradition that eggplants could cause insanity. Translated into English as 'mad-apple',[26] 'rage-apple', or 'raging apple', this name for eggplants is attested from 1578 and the form 'mad-apple' may still be found in Southern American English.[27]\n\n### Other English Names\nThe plant is also known as guinea squash in Southern American English. The term guinea in the name originally denoted the fact that the fruits were associated with West Africa, specifically the region that is now the modern day country Guinea.[27] It has been known as 'Jew's apple',[26][28] apparently in relation to a belief that the fruit was first imported to the West Indies by Jewish people.[28]\n\n### History\nThere is no consensus about the place of origin of eggplant; the plant species has been described as native to South Asia,[29][30] where it continues to grow wild, or Africa.[31] It has been cultivated in southern and eastern Asia since prehistory. The earliest known mention of the eggplant is in the 59 BCE \"Slave's Contract\" (僮約; tóng yuē) by Chinese poet Wang Bao (王褒);[32][33] subsequently, the plant was mentioned in other later sources such as Qimin Yaoshu, an agricultural treatise completed in 544 CE.[33][34] Eggplant was introduced to Europe through the Iberian Peninsula, where it became a staple among Muslim and Jewish communities.[35] The presence of numerous Arabic and North African names for the vegetable, coupled with the absence of ancient Greek and Roman names, suggests that it was cultivated in the Mediterranean area by Arabs during the early Middle Ages, arriving in Spain in the 8th century.[36] A book on agriculture by Ibn Al-Awwam in 12th-century Muslim Spain described how to grow aubergines.[37] Records exist from later medieval Catalan and Spanish,[38] as well as from 14th-century Italy.[39] Unlike its popularity in Spain and limited presence in southern Italy, the eggplant remained relatively obscure in other regions of Europe until the 17th century.[35] The aubergine is unrecorded in England until the 16th century. An English botany book in 1597 described the madde or raging Apple: This plant groweth in Egypt almost everywhere... bringing foorth fruite of the bignes of a great Cucumber.... We have had the same in our London gardens, where it hath borne flowers, but the winter approching before the time of ripening, it perished: notwithstanding it came to beare fruite of the bignes of a goose egge one extraordinarie temperate yeere... but never to the full ripenesse.[40] The Europeans brought it to the Americas.[41] Because of the plant's relationship with various other nightshades, the fruit was at one time believed to be extremely poisonous. The flowers and leaves can be poisonous if consumed in large quantities due to the presence of solanine.[42] The eggplant has a special place in folklore. In 13th-century Italian traditional folklore, the eggplant can cause insanity.[43] In 19th-century ",

    "content": "### Description\nThe species is a perennial, often cultivated as an annual in temperate climates, often growing to around 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall. As a member of the Malvaceae, it is related to such species as cotton, cocoa, and hibiscus. The leaves are 10–20 centimetres (4–8 in) long and broad, palmately lobed with 5–7 lobes. The flowers are 4–8 cm (1+5⁄8–3+1⁄8 in) in diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base. The pollen grains are spherical and approximately 188 microns in diameter. The fruit is a capsule up to 18 cm (7 in) long with pentagonal cross-section, containing numerous seeds.\n\n### Etymology\nThe scientific name can be broken down and translated: Abelmoschus is Neo-Latin from Arabic: أَبُو المِسْك, romanized: ʾabū l-misk, lit. 'father of musk',[6] which was likely derived from the plant's seeds displaying a sweet, musky aroma when crushed; esculentus is Latin for 'edible' or 'being fit for human consumption'.[7] Okra is known as bhindi (pronounced [pɪɳ˩˨.ɖiː]; Punjabi: ਭਿੰਡੀ/بھنڈی/پنڈی)(pronounced [bʱɪnɖiː]; Urdu: بھنڈی) in Pakistan, where it is the national vegetable.[8] The first use of the word okra (alternatively; okro or ochro) appeared in 1679 in the Colony of Virginia, deriving from Igbo: ọ́kwụ̀rụ̀.[9] Another common name for okra in the Americas is gumbo, which entered American English around 1805 via Louisiana Creole,[10] and traces back to Bantu languages such as Umbundu: ochinggõmbo[11] or Kimbundu: kingombo.[12] Although gumbo now primarily denotes a stew-like dish across much of the United States, in the Deep South and among African diaspora communities, it has long referred to the okra plant and its pods.[13]\n\n### Origin And Distribution\nOkra is an allopolyploid of uncertain parentage. However, proposed parents include Abelmoschus ficulneus, A. tuberculatus and a reported diploid form of okra.[14] Truly wild (as opposed to naturalised) populations are not known with certainty, and the West African variety has been described as a cultigen.[15] Okra originated in East Africa in Ethiopia, Eritrea and eastern Sudan.[4][16] From Arabia, the plant spread around the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and eastward.[16] Okra was introduced to Europe by the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.[citation needed] One of the earliest accounts is by Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, who visited Ayyubid Egypt in 1216 and described the plant under cultivation by the locals who ate the tender young pods with meal.[17] The plant was introduced to the Americas by ships plying the Atlantic slave trade[18] by 1658, when its presence was recorded in Brazil. It was further documented in Suriname in 1686. Okra may have been introduced to southeastern North America from Africa in the early 18th century. By 1748 it was being grown as far north as Philadelphia.[19] Thomas Jefferson noted it was well established in Virginia by 1781. It was commonplace throughout the Southern United States by 1800, and the first mention of different cultivars was in 1806.[4]\n\n### Cultivation\nAbelmoschus esculentus is cultivated throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world for its fibrous fruits or pods containing round, white seeds. It is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetable species in the world and will tolerate soils with heavy clay and intermittent moisture, but frost can damage the pods. In cultivation, the seeds are soaked overnight prior to planting to a depth of 1–2 cm (3⁄8–13⁄16 in). It prefers a soil temperature of at least 20 °C (68 °F) for germination, which occurs between six days (soaked seeds) and three weeks. As a tropical plant, it also requires a lot of sunlight, and it should also be cultivated in soil that has a pH between 5.8 and 7, ideally on the acidic side.[20] Seedlings require ample water. The seed pods rapidly become fibrous and woody and, to be edible as a vegetable, must be harvested when immature, usually within a week of pollination.[21] The first harvest will typically be ready about 2 months after planting, and the pods will be approximately 2–3 inches (51–76 mm) long.[20] The most common disease afflicting the okra plant is verticillium wilt, often causing a yellowing and wilting of the leaves. Other diseases include powdery mildew in dry tropical regions, leaf spots, yellow mosaic and root-knot nematodes. Resistance to yellow mosaic virus in A. esculentus was transferred through a cross with Abelmoschus manihot and resulted in a new variety called Parbhani kranti.[22] In the U.S. much of the supply is grown in Florida, especially around Dade in southern Florida.[23][24] Okra is grown throughout the state to some degree, so okra is available ten months of the year.[23] Yields range from less than 18,000 pounds per acre (20,000 kg/ha) to over 30,000 pounds per acre (34,000 kg/ha).[23] Wholesale prices can go as high as $18/bushel which is $0.60 per pound ($1.3/kg).[23] The Regional IPM Centers provide integrated pest management plans for use in the state.[23]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of okra was 11.5 million tonnes, led by India with 62% of the total, and Nigeria and Mali as secondary producers (table).\n\n### Nutrition\nRaw okra is 90% water, 7% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and has negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of 100 g (3.5 oz), raw okra supplies 33 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C and vitamin K (table). It has moderate content (10-19% DV) of thiamine, folate, magnesium, and potassium (table).\n\n### Culinary\nOkra is one of three thickeners that may be used in gumbo soup from Louisiana.[28] Fried okra is a dish from the Cuisine of the Southern United States. In Cuba and Puerto Rico, the vegetable is referred to as quimbombó, and is used in dishes such as quimbombó guisado (stewed okra), a dish similar to gumbo.[29][30] It is also used in traditional dishes in the Dominican Republic, where it is called molondrón.[31] In Brazil, it is an important component of several regional dishes, such as caruru, made with shrimp, in the Northeastern region, and frango com quiabo (chicken with okra) and carne refogada com quiabo (stewed meat with okra) in Minas Gerais. In South Asia, the pods are used in many spicy vegetable preparations as well as cooked with beef, mutton, lamb and chicken.[32][33]\n\n### Pods\nThe pods of the plant are mucilaginous, resulting in the characteristic \"goo\" or slime when the seed pods are cooked; the mucilage contains soluble fiber.[34] One possible way to de-slime okra is to cook it with an acidic food, such as tomatoes, to minimize the mucilage.[35] Pods are cooked, pickled, eaten raw, or included in salads. Okra may be used in developing countries to mitigate malnutrition and alleviate food insecurity.[34]\n\n### Leaves And Seeds\nYoung okra leaves may be cooked similarly to the greens of beets or dandelions, or used in salads. Okra seeds may be roasted and ground to form a caffeine-free substitute for coffee.[4] When importation of coffee was disrupted by the American Civil War in 1861, the Austin State Gazette said, \"An acre of okra will produce seed enough to furnish a plantation with coffee in every way equal to that imported from Rio.\"[36] Greenish-yellow edible okra oil is pressed from okra seeds; it has a pleasant taste and odor, and is high in unsaturated fats such as oleic acid and linoleic acid.[37] The oil content of some varieties of the seed is about 40%. At 794 kilograms per hectare (708 lb/acre), the yield was exceeded only by that of sunflower oil in one trial.[38]\n\n### Industrial\nBast fibre from the stem of the plant has industrial uses such as the reinforcement of polymer composites.[39] The mucilage produced by the okra plant can be used for the removal of turbidity from wastewater by virtue of its flocculant properties.[40][41] Having composition similar to a thick polysaccharide film, okra mucilage is under development as a biodegradable food packaging, as of 2018.[42] A",

    "content": "### Description\nThe cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils.[7] The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits.[8] The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (4 in) in diameter.[9] Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table). In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with seeds and an outer rind.[10] In a culinary context, it is considered a vegetable.[10]\n\n### Flowering And Pollination\nMost cucumber cultivars are seeded and require pollination. For this purpose, thousands of honey beehives are annually carried to cucumber fields just before bloom. Cucumbers may also be pollinated via bumblebees and several other bee species. Most cucumbers that require pollination are self-incompatible, thus requiring the pollen of another plant in order to form seeds and fruit.[11] Some self-compatible cultivars exist that are related to the 'Lemon cucumber' cultivar.[11] A few cultivars of cucumber are parthenocarpic, the blossoms of which create seedless fruit without pollination, which degrades the eating quality of these cultivar. In the United States, these are usually grown in greenhouses, where bees are excluded. In Europe, they are grown outdoors in some regions, where bees are likewise excluded.[citation needed] Traditional cultivars produce male blossoms first, then female, in about equivalent numbers. Newer gynoecious hybrid cultivars produce almost all female blossoms. They may have a pollenizer cultivar interplanted, and the number of beehives per unit area is increased, but temperature changes induce male flowers even on these plants, which may be sufficient for pollination to occur.[11] In 2009, an international team of researchers announced they had sequenced the cucumber genome.[12] A study of genetic recombination during meiosis in cucumber provided a high resolution landscape of meiotic DNA double strand-breaks and genetic crossovers.[13]\n\n### Herbivore Defense\nPhytochemicals in cucumbers may discourage natural foraging by herbivores, such as insects, nematodes or wildlife.[14] As a possible defense mechanism, cucumbers produce cucurbitacin C,[15] which causes a bitter taste in some cucumber varieties. This potential mechanism is under preliminary research to identify whether cucumbers are able to deter herbivores and environmental stresses by using an intrinsic chemical defense, particularly in the leaves, cotyledons, pedicel, carpopodium, and fruit.[15][16]\n\n### Nutrition\nRaw cucumber (with peel) is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5 oz), raw cucumber provides 16 calories of food energy, and has a low content of micronutrients notable only for vitamin K at 14% of the Daily Value (table).\n\n### Aroma And Taste\nDepending on variety, cucumbers may have a mild melon aroma and flavor, in part resulting from unsaturated aldehydes, such as (E,Z)-nona-2,6-dienal, and the cis- and trans- isomers of 2-nonenal.[19] The slightly bitter taste of cucumber rind results from cucurbitacins.[20] Research from 2018 found that polyphenol content was higher in unpeeled cucumbers.[21]\n\n### Varieties\nIn general cultivation, cucumbers are classified into three main cultivar groups: slicing, pickling, and seedless/burpless.\n\n### Fruit\nCucumbers grown to eat fresh are called slicing cucumbers. The main varieties of slicers mature on vines with large leaves that provide shading.[8][22] Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color, and have much tougher skin. In contrast, those in other countries, often called European cucumbers, are smaller and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus are often sold in plastic skin for protection. This variety may also be called a telegraph cucumber, particularly in Australasia.[23] Pickling with brine, sugar, vinegar, and spices creates various flavored products from cucumbers and other foods.[24] Although any cucumber can be pickled, commercial pickles are made from cucumbers specially bred for uniformity of length-to-diameter ratio and lack of voids in the flesh. Those cucumbers intended for pickling, called picklers, grow to about 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide. Compared to slicers, picklers tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines. Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.[citation needed] Gherkins, also called cornichons,[25] or baby pickles, are small cucumbers, typically those 2.5 to 12.5 centimetres (1 to 5 in) in length, often with bumpy skin, which are typically used for pickling.[26][27][28] The word gherkin comes from the early modern Dutch gurken or augurken ('small pickled cucumber').[29] The term is also used in the name for Cucumis anguria, the West Indian gherkin, a closely related species.[30] Burpless cucumbers are sweeter and have a thinner skin than other varieties of cucumber. They are reputed to be easy to digest and to have a pleasant taste. They can grow as long as 60 centimeters (2 ft), are nearly seedless, and have a delicate skin. Most commonly grown in greenhouses, these parthenocarpic cucumbers are often found in grocery markets, shrink-wrapped in plastic. They are marketed as either burpless or seedless, as the seeds and skin of other varieties of cucumbers are said to give some people gas.[31]\n\n### Shoots\nCucumber shoots are regularly consumed as a vegetable, especially in rural areas. In Thailand they are often served with a crab meat sauce. They can also be stir fried or used in soups.[32]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of cucumbers and gherkins was 98 million tonnes, led by China with 82% of the total.[33]\n\n### Cultivation History\nCultivated for at least 3,000 years, the cultivated cucumbers \"Cucumis sativus\" were domesticated in India from wild \"C. sativus var. hardwickii\".[3][4][6] where a great many varieties have been observed, along with its closest living relative, Cucumis hystrix.[34] The three main cultivar groups of cucumber are Eurasian cucumbers (slicing cucumbers eaten raw and immature), East Asian cucumbers (pickling cucumbers), and Xishuangbanna cucumbers. Based on demographic modelling, the East Asian C. sativus cultivars diverged from the Indian cultivars about 2,500 years ago.[35] It was probably introduced to Europe by the Greeks or Romans. Records of cucumber cultivation appear in France in the 9th century, England in the 14th century, and in North America by the mid-16th century.[1][36][37][38]\n\n### Roman Empire\nAccording to Pliny the Elder, the Emperor Tiberius had the cucumber on his table daily during summer and winter. In order to have it available for his table every day of the year, the Romans reportedly used artificial growing methods (similar to the greenhouse system) using mirrorstone, Pliny's lapis specularis, believed to have been sheet mica:[39][40] Indeed, he was never without it; for he had raised beds made in frames upon wheels, by means of which the cucumbers were moved and exposed to the full heat of the sun; while, in winter, they were withdrawn, and placed under the protection of frames glazed with mirrorstone. — Pliny the Elder, Natural History XIX.xxiii, \"Vegetables of a Cartilaginous Nature—Cucumbers. Pepones\" Reportedly, they were also cultivated in specularia, cucumber houses glazed with oiled cloth.[39] Pliny describes the Italian fruit as very small, probably like a gherkin. He also describes the preparation of a medication known as elaterium. H",

    "content": "### Etymology And Terminology\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English word pumpkin is a 17th-century corruption of the earlier pompion, denoting any of various kinds of edible gourd. The latter ultimately derives, via French and Latin, from Greek πέπων (pepōn).[6] An alternative theory derives pumpkin from the Massachusett word pôhpukun, meaning \"grows forth round\".[7] This term could have been used by the Wampanoag people (who speak the Wôpanâak dialect of Massachusett) when introducing pumpkins to English Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony, located in present-day Massachusetts.[8] (The English word squash is derived from a Massachusett word, askꝏtasquash,[9] or, in the closely related Narragansett language, askútasquash.)[10] Researchers have noted that the term pumpkin and related terms like ayote and calabaza are applied to a range of winter squash with varying size and shape.[1] The term tropical pumpkin is sometimes used for pumpkin cultivars of the species Cucurbita moschata.[11]\n\n### Description\nPumpkin fruits are a type of berry known as a pepo.[12] Characteristics commonly used to define pumpkin include smooth and slightly ribbed skin[13] and deep yellow to orange color,[13] although white, green, and other pumpkin colors also exist.[14] While Cucurbita pepo pumpkins generally weigh between 3 and 8 kilograms (6 and 18 lb), giant pumpkins can exceed a tonne in mass.[15][16] Most are varieties of C. maxima that were developed through the efforts of botanical societies and enthusiast farmers.[15] The largest cultivars frequently reach weights of over 34 kg (75 lb). In October 2023, the record for heaviest pumpkin was set at 1,246.9 kg (2,749 lbs.).[17]\n\n### History\nThe oldest evidence of Cucurbita pepo is pumpkin fragments found in Mexico that are dated between 7,000 and 5,500 BC.[18] Pumpkins and other squash species, alongside maize and beans, feature in the Three Sisters method of companion planting practiced by many North American indigenous societies.[19] However, larger modern pumpkin cultivars are typically excluded, as their weight may damage the other crops.[20] Within decades after Europeans began colonizing North America, illustrations of pumpkins similar to the modern cultivars Small Sugar pumpkin and Connecticut Field pumpkin were published in Europe.[12]\n\n### Cultivation\nPumpkins are a warm-weather crop that is usually planted by early July in the Northern Hemisphere. Pumpkins require that soil temperatures 8 centimetres (3 in) deep are at least 15.5 °C (60 °F) and that the soil holds water well. Pumpkin crops may suffer if there is a lack of water, because of temperatures below 18 °C or 65 °F, or if grown in  soils that become waterlogged. Within these conditions, pumpkins are considered hardy, and even if many leaves and portions of the vine are removed or damaged, the plant can quickly grow secondary vines to replace what was removed.[21] Pumpkins produce both a male and female flower, with fertilization usually performed by bees.[21] In America, pumpkins have historically been pollinated by the native squash bee, Peponapis pruinosa, but that bee has declined, probably partly due to pesticide (imidacloprid) sensitivity.[22] Ground-based bees, such as squash bees and the eastern bumblebee, are better suited to manage the larger pollen particles that pumpkins create.[23][24] One hive per acre (0.4 hectares, or five hives per 2 hectares) is recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. If there are inadequate bees for pollination, gardeners may have to hand pollinate. Inadequately pollinated pumpkins usually start growing but fail to develop.\n\n### Production\nIn 2022, world production of pumpkins (including squash and gourds) was 23 million tonnes, with China accounting for 32% of the total. Ukraine, Russia, and the United States each produced about one million tonnes.[25] As one of the most popular crops in the United States, in 2017 over 680 million kilograms (1.5 billion pounds) of pumpkins were produced.[21] The top pumpkin-producing states include Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and California.[4] Pumpkin is the state squash of Texas.[26] According to the Illinois Department of Agriculture, 95 percent of the U.S. crop intended for processing is grown in Illinois.[27] Indeed, 41 percent of the overall pumpkin crop for all uses originates in the state, more than five times that of the nearest competitor, California, whose pumpkin industry is centered in the San Joaquin Valley; and the majority of that comes from five counties in the central part of the state.[28] Nestlé, operating under the brand name Libby's, produces 85 percent of the processed pumpkin in the United States at their plant in Morton, Illinois. In the fall of 2009, rain in Illinois devastated the Libby's pumpkin crop, which, combined with a relatively weak 2008 crop depleting that year's reserves, resulted in a shortage affecting the entire country during the Thanksgiving holiday season.[29] Another shortage, somewhat less severe, affected the 2015 crop.[30][31] The pumpkin crop in the western United States, which constitutes approximately three to four percent of the national crop, is grown primarily for the organic market.[32] Terry County, Texas, has a substantial pumpkin industry, centered largely on miniature pumpkins.[28] Illinois farmer Sarah Frey is called \"the Pumpkin Queen of America\" and sells around five million pumpkins annually, predominantly for use as Jack-o-lanterns.[33][34]\n\n### Nutrition\nIn a 100-gram (3.5 oz) amount, raw pumpkin provides 110 kilojoules (26 kilocalories) of food energy and is an excellent source (20% or more the Daily Value, DV) of provitamin A beta-carotene and vitamin A (47% DV) (table). Vitamin C is present in moderate content (10% DV), but no other micronutrients are in significant amounts (less than 10% DV, table). Pumpkin is 92% water, 6.5% carbohydrate, 0.1% fat and 1% protein (table).\n\n### Culinary\nMost parts of the pumpkin plant are edible, including the fleshy shell, the seeds, the leaves, and the flowers. When ripe, the pumpkin can be boiled, steamed, or roasted. In North America, pumpkins are part of the traditional autumn harvest, eaten roasted, as mashed pumpkin[37] and in soups and pumpkin bread. Pumpkin pie is a traditional staple of the Canadian and American Thanksgiving holidays.[38] Pumpkin purée is sometimes prepared and frozen for later use.[39] In the southwestern United States and Mexico, pumpkin and squash flowers are a popular and widely available food item. They may be used to garnish dishes, or dredged in a batter then fried in oil. Pumpkin leaves are also eaten in Zambia, where they are called chibwabwa and are boiled and cooked with groundnut paste as a side dish.[40] Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are edible and nutrient-rich. They are about 1.5 cm (0.5 in) long, flat, asymmetrically oval, light green in color and usually covered by a white husk, although some pumpkin varieties produce seeds without them. Pumpkin seeds are a popular snack that can be found hulled or semi-hulled at grocery stores. Per ounce serving, pumpkin seeds are a good source of protein, magnesium, copper and zinc.[41] Pumpkin seed oil is a thick oil pressed from roasted seeds that appears red or green in color.[42][43] When used for cooking or as a salad dressing, pumpkin seed oil is generally mixed with other oils because of its robust flavor.[44] Pumpkin seed oil contains fatty acids such as oleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.[45]\n\n### Animal Feed\nPumpkin seed meal from Cucurbita maxima and Cucurbita moschata have been demonstrated to improve the nutrition of eggs for human consumption, and Cucurbita pepo seed has successfully been used in place of soybean in chicken feed.[46]\n\n### Halloween\nIn the United States, the carved pumpkin was first associated with the harvest season in general, long before it became an emblem of Halloween.[47] The practice of carving produce for Halloween originated ",

    "title": "Radish",
    "content": "### History\nVarieties of radish are now broadly distributed globally, but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication.[4] However, scientists have tentatively located the origin of Raphanus sativus in Southeast Asia, as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered. India, central China, and Central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed. Radishes enter the historical record in third century BC.[5] Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the first century AD gave details of small, large, round, long, mild, and sharp varieties.[6] The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas. A German botanist reported radishes of 45 kilograms (100 pounds) and roughly 90 centimetres (3 feet) in length in 1544, although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish.[6] The large, mild, and white East Asian form was developed in China, though it is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon, owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports.[citation needed]\n\n### Folklore\nAsaph the Jew noted that the radish, particularly its leaves, may be useful in traditional medicine to increase mucus.[7] During the Middle Ages, Ibn Wahshiyya considered it a component of poison antidotes, while Maimonides highlighted its possible uses as a treatment.[7] Al-Warraq's 10th-century cookbook includes radish as a side dish for ostrich meat and an ingredient in a chicken dish called kardanāj.[7]\n\n### Description\nRadishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular, tapering, or cylindrical. The root skin colour ranges from white through pink, red, purple, yellow, and green to black, but the flesh is usually white. The roots obtain their color from anthocyanins. Red varieties use the anthocyanin pelargonidin as a pigment, and purple cultivars obtain their color from cyanidin.[8] Smaller types have a few leaves about 13 cm (5 in) long with round roots up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter or more slender, long roots up to 7 cm (3 in) long. Both of these are normally eaten raw in salads.[9] A longer root form, including oriental radishes, daikon or mooli, and winter radishes, grows up to 60 cm (24 in) long with foliage about 60 cm (24 in) high with a spread of 45 cm (18 in).[9] The flesh of radishes harvested timely is crisp and sweet, but becomes bitter and tough if the vegetable is left in the ground too long.[10] Leaves are arranged in a rosette. They have a lyrate shape, meaning they are divided pinnately with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes. The white flowers are borne on a racemose inflorescence.[11] The fruits are small pods which can be eaten when young.[9] The radish is a diploid species, and has 18 chromosomes (2n=18).[12] It is estimated that the radish genome contains between 526 and 574 Mb.[8]\n\n### Varieties\nRadishes can be categorized into four main types according to the seasons when they are grown and a variety of shapes, lengths, colors, and sizes, such as red, pink, white, gray-black, or yellow radishes, with round or elongated roots that can grow longer than a parsnip.\n\n### Cultivation\nRadishes are a fast-growing, annual, cool-season crop. The seed germinates in three to four days in moist conditions with soil temperatures between 18 and 29 °C (65 and 85 °F). Best quality roots are obtained under moderate day lengths with air temperatures in the range 10 to 18 °C (50 to 65 °F). Under average conditions, the crop matures in 3–4 weeks, but in colder weather, 6–7 weeks may be required.[13] Homegrown varieties can be significantly sharper. Radishes grow best in full sun in light, sandy loams, with a soil pH 6.5 to 7.0, but for late-season crops, a clayey-loam is ideal. Soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather are unsuitable and can impair germination.[14][15][16]  Harvesting periods can be extended by making repeat plantings, spaced a week or two apart. In warmer climates, radishes are normally planted in the autumn.[14] The depth at which seeds are planted affects the size of the root, from 1 cm (1⁄2 in) deep recommended for small radishes to 4 cm (1+1⁄2 in) for large radishes.[16] During the growing period, the crop needs to be thinned and weeds controlled, and irrigation may be required.[14] Radishes are a common garden crop in many parts of the world, and the fast harvest cycle makes them particularly suitable for children's gardens.[15] After harvesting, radishes can be stored without loss of quality for two or three days at room temperature, and about two months at 0 °C (32 °F) with a relative humidity of 90–95%.[11]\n\n### Companion Plant\nRadishes can be useful as companion plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants.[17] They can also function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop.[18] Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.[17]\n\n### Pests\nAs a fast-growing plant, diseases are not generally a problem with radishes, but some insect pests can be a nuisance. The larvae of flea beetles live in the soil, but the adult beetles cause damage to the crop, biting small \"shot holes\" in the leaves, especially of seedlings. The swede midge (Contarinia nasturtii) attacks the foliage and growing tip of the plant and causes distortion, multiple (or no) growing tips, and swollen or crinkled leaves and stems. The larvae of the cabbage root fly sometimes attack the roots. The foliage droops and becomes discoloured, and small, white maggots tunnel through the root, making it unattractive or inedible.[13]\n\n### Spring Or Summer Radishes\nSometimes referred to as European radishes or spring radishes if they are planted in cooler weather, summer radishes are generally small and have a relatively short three- to four-week cultivation time.[9]\n\n### Winter Varieties\n'Black Spanish' or 'Black Spanish Round' occur in both round and elongated forms, and are sometimes simply called the black radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. niger (M.) S.K. or L. ssp. niger (M.). D.C. var. albus D.C) or known by the French name Gros Noir d'Hiver. It dates in Europe to 1548,[19] and was a common garden variety in England and France during the early 19th century.[20] It has a rough, black skin with hot-flavored, white flesh, is round or irregularly pear shaped,[21] and grows to around 10 cm (4 in) in diameter.[citation needed] Daikon refers to a wide variety of winter oilseed radishes from Asia. While the Japanese name daikon has been adopted in English, it is also sometimes called the Japanese radish, Chinese radish, Oriental radish, or mooli (in India and South Asia).[22] Daikons commonly have elongated white roots, although many varieties of daikon exist. One well-known variety is 'April Cross', with smooth white roots.[15][16] The New York Times describes 'Masato Red' and 'Masato Green' varieties as extremely long, well-suited for fall planting and winter storage.[15] The Sakurajima radish is a hot-flavored variety which is typically grown to around 10 kg (22 lb), but which can grow to 30 kg (66 lb) when left in the ground.[15][23] Korean radish, also called mu(무), is a variety of white radish with firm crunchy texture.[24] Although mu is also a generic term for radishes in Korean (as daikon is a generic term for radishes in Japanese), the word is usually used in its narrow sense, referring to Joseon radish(조선무, Joseonmu). In Korean cuisine context, the word Joseon is often used in contrast to Wae, to distinguish Korean varieties from Japanese ones. The longer, thinner, and waterier Japanese daikon cultivat",

    "content": "### Description\nGarlic is a perennial flowering plant that is native to Central Asia, South Asia and northeastern Iran.[1][4] It grows from a bulb, with a tall, erect flowering stem that reaches up to 1 m (3 ft). The leaf blade is flat, linear, solid, and approximately 1.25–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) wide, with an acute apex. The plant may produce pink to purple flowers from July to September in the Northern Hemisphere. The bulb has a strong odor and is typically made up of 10 to 20 cloves. The cloves close to the center are symmetrical, and those surrounding the center can be asymmetrical. Each clove is enclosed in an inner sheathing leaf surrounded by layers of outer sheathing leaves.[11] If garlic is planted at the proper time and depth, it can be grown as far north as Alaska.[12] It produces hermaphroditic flowers. It is pollinated by butterflies, moths, and other insects.[13]\n\n### Chemistry\nFresh or crushed garlic yields the sulfur-containing compounds allicin, ajoene, diallyl polysulfides, vinyldithiins, and S-allylcysteine, as well as enzymes, saponins, flavonoids, and Maillard reaction products when cooked, which are not sulfur-containing compounds. The phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol).[14] The resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time.[15] Among alliums, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks.[15] Although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant.[16] A large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic. Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the \"hot\" sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermo-transient receptor potential channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness.[16] Allicin, along with its decomposition products diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as vinyldithiins and ajoene.[2]\n\n### Taxonomy\nIdentification of the wild progenitor of common garlic is difficult due to the sterility of its many cultivars, which limits the ability to cross test with wild relatives.[citation needed][a] Genetically and morphologically, garlic is most similar to the wild species Allium longicuspis, which grows in central and southwestern Asia.[19][20][21] However, because A. longicuspis is also mostly sterile, it is doubtful that it is the ancestor of A. sativum.[19] Other candidates that have been suggested include A. tuncelianum, A. macrochaetum, and A. truncatum, all of which are native to the Middle East.[19] Allium sativum grows in the wild in areas where it has become naturalized. The \"wild garlic\", \"crow garlic\", and \"field garlic\" of Britain are members of the species A. ursinum, A. vineale, and A. oleraceum, respectively. In North America, A. vineale (known as \"wild garlic\" or \"crow garlic\") and Allium canadense (known as \"meadow garlic\", \"wild garlic\", or \"wild onion\") are common weeds in fields.[22] So-called elephant garlic is actually a wild leek (A. ampeloprasum) and not a true garlic. Single clove garlic (also called pearl or solo garlic) originated in the Yunnan province of China.\n\n### Subspecies And Varieties\nThere are two subspecies of A. sativum,[23] ten major groups of varieties, and hundreds of varieties, or cultivars. There are at least 120 cultivars originating from Central Asia, making it the main center of garlic biodiversity.[24] Some garlics have protected status in the UK and the EU,[25] including:\n\n### Etymology\nThe word garlic derives from Old English, garlēac, meaning gar (spear) and leek, as a 'spear-shaped leek'.[26]\n\n### Ecology\nGarlic plants are usually hardy and not affected by many pests or diseases. Garlic plants are said to repel rabbits and moles.[3] The California Department of Food and Agriculture conducts a certification program to assure freedom from nematode and white rot disease caused by Stromatinia cepivora, two pathogens that can both destroy a crop and remain in the soil indefinitely once introduced.[20] Garlic may also suffer from pink root, a typically non-fatal disease that stunts the roots and turns them pink or red;[27] or leek rust, which usually appears as bright orange spots.[28] The larvae of the leek moth attack garlic by mining into the leaves or bulbs.[29] Botrytis neck and bulb rot is a disease of onion, garlic, leek and shallot. Botrytis allii and Botrytis aclada cause this disease in onion and Botrytis porri causes it in garlic. According to the University of California, Initial symptoms usually begin at the neck, where affected tissue softens, becomes water-soaked, and turns brown. In a humid atmosphere, a gray and feltlike growth (where spores are produced) appears on rotting scales, and mycelia may develop between scales. Dark-brown-to-black sclerotia (the resting bodies of the pathogen) may eventually develop in the neck or between scales.[30]\n\n### Cultivation\nGarlic is easy to cultivate and may grow year-round in mild climates.[28] While sexual propagation of garlic is possible, nearly all of the garlic in cultivation is propagated asexually by planting individual cloves in the ground.[20] \nIn colder climates, cloves are best planted about six weeks before the soil freezes. The goal is to have the bulbs produce only roots and no shoots above the ground.[31]\nHarvest is in late spring or early summer. Garlic plants can be grown closely together, leaving enough space for the bulbs to mature, and are easily grown in containers of sufficient depth. Garlic does well in loose, dry, well-drained soils in sunny locations, and is hardy throughout USDA climate zones 4–9. When selecting garlic for planting, it is important to pick large bulbs from which to separate cloves. Large cloves, along with proper spacing in the planting bed, will also increase bulb size. Garlic plants prefer to grow in a soil with a high organic material content, but are capable of growing in a wide range of soil conditions and pH levels.[20] There are different varieties of garlic, most notably split into the subspecies of hardneck garlic and softneck garlic.[28] The latitude where the garlic is grown affects the choice of type, as garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hardneck garlic is generally grown in cooler climates and produces relatively large cloves, whereas softneck garlic is generally grown closer to the equator and produces small, tightly packed cloves.[28] Garlic scapes are removed to focus all the garlic's energy into bulb growth. The scapes can be eaten raw or cooked.[32][33]\n\n### Propagation\nThe method of propagating garlic from planting cloves is called division. Asexual propagation of garlic for production purposes requires cool temperatures that can vary depending on the cultivar. Hardneck varieties require long cold temperature exposure whereas softneck varieties thrive in milder climates. This cold climate is required for the process of vernalization, a form of stratification of the cloves necessary for the development of multiple-clove bulbs.[34] Solo garlic is the result of garlic grown without the process of vernalization.\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of garlic was 29 million tonnes, with China accounting for 72% of the total (table).\n\n### Adverse Effects And Toxicology\nThe scent of garlic is known to linger upon the human body ",

    "title": "Ginger",
    "content": "### Etymology\nThe English origin of the word \"ginger\" is from the mid-14th century, from Old English gingifer, which derives in turn from the Medieval Latin gingiber, gingiber from the Greek ζιγγίβερις zingiberis[9] from the Prakrit (Middle Indic) siṅgabera, and siṅgabera from the Sanskrit śṛṅgavera. The Sanskrit word is thought to come from an ancient Dravidian word that also produced the Tamil[10] and Malayalam term iñci-vēr (from vēr, \"root\");[11][12] an alternative explanation is that the Sanskrit word comes from srngam, meaning \"horn\", and vera, meaning \"body\" (describing the shape of its root), but that may be folk etymology.[12] The word probably was readopted in Middle English from the Old French gingibre (modern French gingembre).[11]\n\n### Origin And Distribution\nGinger originated from Maritime Southeast Asia. It is a true cultigen and does not exist in its wild state.[13][14] The most ancient evidence of its domestication is among the Austronesian peoples where it was among several species of ginger cultivated and exploited since ancient times. They cultivated other gingers including turmeric (Curcuma longa), white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria), and bitter ginger (Zingiber zerumbet). The rhizomes and the leaves were used to flavour food or eaten directly. The leaves were also used to weave mats. Aside from these uses, ginger had religious significance among Austronesians, being used in rituals for healing and for asking protection from spirits. It was also used in the blessing of Austronesian ships.[15][16][17][18][19][20] Ginger was carried with them in their voyages as canoe plants during the Austronesian expansion, starting from around 5,000 BP. They introduced it to the Pacific Islands in prehistory, long before any contact with other civilizations. Reflexes of the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word *laqia are found in Austronesian languages all the way to Hawaii.[21][17] They also presumably introduced it to India along with other Southeast Asian food plants and Austronesian sailing technologies, during early contact by Austronesian sailors with the Dravidian-speaking peoples of Sri Lanka and South India at around 3,500 BP.[15][19][22] It was also carried by Austronesian voyagers into Madagascar and the Comoros in the 1st millennium CE.[23] From India, it was carried by traders into the Middle East and the Mediterranean by around the 1st century CE. It was primarily grown in southern India and the Greater Sunda Islands during the spice trade, along with peppers, cloves, and numerous other spices.[14][24]\n\n### History\nThe first written record of ginger comes from the Analects, written by the Disciples of Confucius[25] in China during the Warring States period (475–221 BCE).[26] In it, Confucius was said to eat ginger with every meal.[26] In 406, the monk Faxian wrote that ginger was grown in pots and carried on Chinese ships to prevent scurvy.[26] During the Song dynasty (960–1279), ginger was being imported into China from southern countries.[26] Ginger spice was introduced to the Mediterranean by the Arabs, and described by writers like Dioscorides (40–90) and Pliny the Elder (24–79).[26] In 150, Ptolemy noted that ginger was produced in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).[26] Ginger—along with its relative, galangal—was imported into the Roman Empire as part of very expensive herbal remedies that only the wealthy could afford, e.g. for the kidneys. Aëtius of Amida describes both ginger and galangal as ingredients in his complex herbal prescriptions.[27] Raw and preserved ginger were imported into Europe in increased quantity during the Middle Ages after European tastes shifted favorably towards its culinary properties; during this time, ginger was described in the official pharmacopeias of several countries.[8] In 14th century England, a pound of ginger cost as much as a sheep.[26] Archaeological evidence of ginger in northwest Europe comes from the wreck of the Danish-Norwegian flagship, Gribshunden. The ship sank off the southern coast of Sweden in the summer of 1495 while conveying King Hans to a summit with the Swedish Council. Among the luxuries carried on the ship were ginger, cloves, saffron, and pepper.[28] The ginger plant was smuggled onto the Caribbean islands from Asia sometime in the 16th century, along with black pepper, cloves, and cinnamon, at the encouragement of the Spanish Crown, though only ginger thrived. It eventually displaced sugar to become the leading export crop on both Hispaniola and Puerto Rico by the end of the century, until the introduction of slave labour from Africa made sugar more economical to produce in the 17th century.[29]\n\n### Horticulture\nGinger produces clusters of white and pink flower buds that bloom into yellow flowers. Because of its aesthetic appeal and the adaptation of the plant to warm climates, it is often used as landscaping around subtropical homes. It is a perennial reed-like plant with annual leafy stems, about a meter (3 to 4 feet) tall. Traditionally, the rhizome is gathered when the stalk withers; it is immediately scalded, or washed and scraped, to kill it and prevent sprouting. The fragrant perisperm of the Zingiberaceae is used as sweetmeats by Bantu, and also as a condiment and sialogogue.[30]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of raw ginger was 4.9 million tonnes, led by India with 45% of the total, and Nigeria and China as secondary producers.[31]\n\n### Production In India\nThough it is grown in many areas across the globe, ginger is \"among the earliest recorded spices to be cultivated and exported from southwest India\".[32] India holds the seventh position in ginger export worldwide, however is the \"largest producer of ginger in the world\".[33] Regions in southwest and Northeast India are most suitable for ginger production due to their warm and humid climate, average rainfall and land space.[34] Ginger has the ability to grow in a wide variety of land types and areas, however is best produced when grown in a warm, humid environment, at an elevation between 300 and 900 m (1,000 and 3,000 ft), and in well-drained soils at least 30 cm deep.[35] A period of low rainfall prior to growing and well-distributed rainfall during growing are also essential for the ginger to thrive well in the soil.[36] Ginger produced in India is most often farmed through homestead farming, with work adaptively shared by available family and community members.[35][37][38]\n\n### Ginger Farming\nThe size of the ginger rhizome is essential to the production of ginger. The larger the rhizome piece, the faster ginger will be produced and therefore the faster it will be sold onto the market.[39] Prior to planting the seed rhizomes, farmers are required to treat the seeds to prevent pests, and rhizome rot and other seed-borne diseases.[39] Various ways Indian farmers do seed treatment include dipping the seeds in cow dung emulsion, smoking the seeds before storage, and hot water treatment.[39] Once the seeds are properly treated, the farmland in which they are to be planted must be thoroughly dug or ploughed by the farmer to break up the soil.[39] After the soil is sufficiently ploughed (at least 3–5 times), water channels are made 60–80 feet (18–24 m) apart to irrigate the crop.[39] The next step is planting the rhizome seed. In India, planting the irrigated ginger crop is usually done in the months between March and June as those months account for the beginning of the monsoon, or rainy season.[39] Once the planting stage is done, farmers go on to mulch the crop to conserve moisture and check weed growth, as well as check surface run-off to conserve soil.[40] Mulching is done by applying mulch (green leaves for example) to the plant beds directly after planting and again 45 and 90 days into growth.[39] After mulching comes hilling, which is the stirring and breaking up of soil to check weed growth, break the firmness of the soil from rain, and conserve soil moisture.[39] Farmers must ensure that their ginger crops are r",

    "content": "### Origins\nCapsicum plants originated in modern-day Peru and Bolivia, and have been a part of human diets since about 7,500 BC.[1][2] They are one of the oldest cultivated crops in the Americas.[2] Chili peppers were cultivated in east-central Mexico some 6,000 years ago,[3][4] and independently across different locations in the Americas including highland Peru and Bolivia, central Mexico, and the Amazon.[5] They were among the first self-pollinating crops cultivated in those areas.[6][2] Peru has the highest diversity of cultivated Capsicum; it is a center of diversification where varieties of all five domesticates were introduced, grown, and consumed in pre-Columbian times.[7] The largest diversity of wild Capsicum peppers is consumed in Bolivia. Bolivian consumers distinguish two basic forms: ulupicas, species with small round fruits including C. eximium, C. cardenasii, C. eshbaughii, and C. caballeroi landraces; and arivivis with small elongated fruits including C. baccatum var. baccatum and C. chacoense varieties.[7]\n\n### Distribution To Europe\nWhen Christopher Columbus and his crew reached the Caribbean, they were the first Europeans to encounter Capsicum fruits. They called them \"peppers\" because, like black pepper (Piper nigrum), which had long been known in Europe, they have a hot spicy taste unlike other foods.[8][9] Chilies were first brought back to Europe by the Spanish, who financed Columbus's voyages, at the start of the large-scale interchange of plants and culture between the New World and the Old World called the Columbian exchange. Chilies appear in Spanish records by 1493. Unlike Piper vines, which grow naturally only in the tropics, chilies could be grown in temperate climates. By the mid-1500s, they had become a common garden plant in Spain and were incorporated into numerous dishes. By 1526, they had appeared in Italy, in 1543 in Germany, and by 1569 in the Balkans, where they came to be processed into paprika.[10][11]\n\n### Distribution To The Rest Of The World\nThe rapid introduction of chilies to Africa and Asia was likely through Portuguese and Spanish traders in the 16th century, though the details are unrecorded. The Portuguese introduced them first to Africa and Arabia, and then to their colonies and trading posts in Asia, including Goa, Sri Lanka, and Malacca. From there, chilies spread to neighboring regions in South Asia and western Southeast Asia via local trade and natural dispersal. Around the same time, the Spanish also introduced chilies to the Philippines, where they spread to Melanesia, Micronesia, and other Pacific Islands via their monopoly of the Manila galleons. Their spread to East Asia in the late 16th century is less clear, but was likely also through local trade or through Portuguese and Spanish trading ports in Canton, China, and Nagasaki, Japan.[12][13][14][15] The earliest known mention of the chili pepper in Chinese writing dates to 1591, though the pepper is thought to have entered the country in the 1570s.[16]\n\n### Cultivation\nChili peppers are the shiny, brightly coloured fruits of species of Capsicum.[17][18] Botanically they are berries. The plants are small, 20 to 60 centimetres (7.9 to 23.6 in) depending on variety, making them suitable for growing in pots, greenhouses, or commercially in polytunnels. The plants are perennial, provided they are protected from cold. The fruits can be green, orange, red, or purple, and vary in shape from round and knobbly to smooth and elongated. If the fruits are picked green and unripe, more flowers develop, yielding more fruit; fruits left on the plant can become hotter in taste, and acquire their ripe coloration, at the price of a reduced harvest.[17] Ideal growing conditions for peppers include a sunny position with warm, loamy soil, ideally 21 to 29 °C (70 to 84 °F), that is moist but not waterlogged.[19] The seeds germinate only when warm, close to 21 °C (70 °F).[17] The plants prefer warm conditions, but can tolerate temperatures down to 12 °C (54 °F); and are sensitive to cold.[17] The flowers can self-pollinate. However, at extremely high temperatures, 30 to 38 °C (86 to 100 °F), pollen loses viability, and its flowers are much less likely to result in fruit.[20] For flowering, Capsicum is a non-photoperiod-sensitive crop.[21] Chilies are vulnerable to pests including aphids, glasshouse red spider mite, and glasshouse whitefly, all of which feed on plant sap.[17] Common diseases include grey mould caused by Botrytis cinerea; this rots the tissues and produces a brownish-grey mould on the surface.[17]\n\n### Preparation\nHarvested chilies may be used fresh, or dried, typically on the ground in hot countries, to make a variety of products. Drying enables chilies grown in temperate regions to be used in winter. For home use, chilies can be dried by threading them with cotton and hanging them up in a warm dry place to dry.[22] Products include whole dried chilies, chili flakes, and chili powder,[23] Fresh or dried chilies are used to make hot sauce, a liquid condiment—usually bottled for commercial use—that adds spice to other dishes.[24] Dried chilies are used to make chili oil, cooking oil infused with chili.[25]\n\n### Annual Production\nIn 2020, 36 million tonnes of green chilies and peppers (counted as any Capsicum or Pimenta fruits) were produced worldwide, with China producing 46% of the total.[26]\n\n### Species And Cultivars\nSpecies of Capsicum that produce chili peppers are shown on the simplified phylogenetic tree,[27] with examples of cultivars:[28] The World Vegetable Center has one of the largest collection of chili peppers in the world. It has researched climate change resistant cultivars.[29] C. annuum: bell peppers,  wax, cayenne, jalapeño, Thai, chiltepin, New Mexico chile C. frutescens: tabasco, malagueta, labuyo, piri piri, kambuzi C. chinense: hottest peppers, e.g. naga, habanero, datil, Scotch bonnet C. baccatum: aji C. pubescens: rocoto, chile de caballo C. eximium[a] C. lycianthoides\n\n### Capsaicin\nThe substances that give chili peppers their pungency (spicy heat) when ingested or applied topically are capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) and several related chemicals, collectively called capsaicinoids.[31][32] Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, and crystalline-to-waxy solid at room temperature.[33] The quantity of capsaicin varies by variety, and depends on growing conditions. Water-stressed peppers usually produce stronger fruits. When a habanero plant is stressed, for example by shortage of water, the concentration of capsaicin increases in some parts of the fruit.[34] When peppers are consumed by mammals such as humans, capsaicin binds with pain receptors in the mouth and throat, potentially evoking pain via spinal relays to the brainstem and thalamus where heat and discomfort are perceived.[35] However, birds are unable to perceive the hotness and so they can eat some of the hottest peppers.[36] The intensity of the \"heat\" of chili peppers is commonly reported in Scoville heat units (SHU), invented by American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912. Historically, it was a measure of the dilution of an amount of chili extract added to sugar syrup before its heat becomes undetectable to a panel of tasters; the more it has to be diluted to be undetectable, the more powerful the variety, and therefore the higher the rating.[37] Since the 1980s, spice heat has been assessed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which measures the concentration of heat-producing capsaicinoids, typically with capsaicin content as the main measure.[38] Capsaicin is produced by the plant as a defense against mammalian predators. A study suggests that by protecting against attack by a hemipteran bug, the risk of disease caused by a Fusarium fungus carried by the insects is reduced.[39] As evidence, the study notes that peppers increased the quantity of capsaicin in proportion to the damage caused by fungi on th",

    "content": "### Description\nThis herbaceous, tendril-bearing vine grows up to 5 m (16 ft) in length. It bears simple, alternate leaves 4–12 cm (1.6–4.7 in) across, with three to seven deeply separated lobes. Each plant bears separate yellow male and female flowers. In the Northern Hemisphere, flowering occurs from June to July, and fruiting from September to November. It is a frost-tender annual in the temperate zone and a perennial in the tropics. It grows best in the USDA zones 9 to 11.[5] The fruit has a distinctive warty exterior and an oblong shape. It is hollow in cross-section, with a relatively thin layer of flesh surrounding a central seed cavity filled with large, flat seeds and pith. The fruit is most often eaten green, or as it is beginning to turn yellow. At this stage, the fruit's flesh is crunchy and watery in texture, similar to cucumber, chayote, or green bell pepper, but bitter. The skin is tender and edible.  Seeds and pith appear white in unripe fruits; they are not intensely bitter and can be removed before cooking. Some sources claim the flesh (rind) becomes somewhat tougher and more bitter with age, but other sources claim that at least for the common Chinese variety the skin does not change and bitterness decreases with age.  The Chinese variety is best harvested light green possibly with a slight yellow tinge or just before.  The pith becomes sweet and intensely red; it can be eaten uncooked in this state and is a popular ingredient in some Southeast Asian salads. When the fruit is fully ripe, it turns orange and soft and splits into segments that curl back to expose seeds covered in bright red pulp.\n\n### Varieties\nBitter melons come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The common Chinese variety is 20–30 cm (7.9–11.8 in) long, oblong with blunt ends, pale green in color, and has a slightly undulating warty surface. The common Indian bitter melon is narrower in shape, pointed at both ends, and covered with jagged, triangular \"teeth\" and ridges. It ranges from green to white in color. There are many intermediate shapes between these two extremes. Some bitter melons produce miniature fruits that are only 6–10 cm (2.4–3.9 in) long and are eaten alone as a stuffed vegetable. These miniature fruits are popular in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and other countries in South Asia. The subcontinental variety is most popular in Bangladesh and India.\n\n### Pests\nM. charantia is one of the main hosts of Bactrocera tau, a fly known to prefer Cucurbitaceae.[6]\n\n### Adverse Effects\nA possible side effect is gastrointestinal discomfort.[7] The ripe fruit and the mature seeds are toxic.[8]\n\n### In Pregnancy\nBitter melon is contraindicated in pregnant women because it can induce bleeding, contractions, and miscarriage.[7]\n\n### Cooking\nBitter melon is generally consumed cooked in the green or early yellowing stage. The young shoots and leaves of the bitter melon may also be eaten as greens. The raw fruit is bitter and can be soaked in cold water and drained to remove some of those strong flavours.[citation needed] In Chinese cuisine, bitter melon (苦瓜, pinyin: kǔguā; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: khó͘-koe) is used in stir-fries (often with pork and douchi), soups, dim sum, and herbal teas (gohyah tea). It has also been used in place of hops as the bittering ingredient in some beers in China and Okinawa.[11] Bitter gourd is commonly eaten throughout India. In North Indian cuisine, it is often served with yogurt on the side to offset the bitterness, used in curry such as sabzi, or stuffed with spices and then cooked in oil. In South Indian cuisine, it is used in numerous dishes such as thoran / thuvaran (mixed with grated coconut), pavaikka mezhukkupuratti (stir-fried with spices), theeyal (cooked with roasted coconut), and pachadi (which is considered a medicinal food for diabetics), making it vital in Malayali's diet. Other popular recipes include preparations with curry, deep-frying with peanuts or other ground nuts, and Kakara kaya pulusu (కాకర కాయ పులుసు) in Telugu, a tamarind-based soup with mini shallots or fried onions and other spices, thickened with chickpea flour. In Karnataka, bitter melon is known as hāgalakāyi (ಹಾಗಲಕಾಯಿ) in Kannada; in Tamil Nadu it is known as paagarkaai or pavakai (பாகற்காய்) in Tamil.[12] In these regions, a special preparation called pagarkai pitla, a kind of sour koottu, is common. Also commonly seen is kattu pagarkkai, a curry in which bitter melons are stuffed with onions, cooked lentils, and grated coconut mix, then tied with thread and fried in oil. In the Konkan region of Maharashtra, salt is added to the finely chopped bitter gourd, known as karle (कारले) in Marathi,  and then it is squeezed, removing its bitter juice to some extent. After frying this with different spices, the less bitter and crispy preparation is served with grated coconut. Bitter melon is known as karate (Konkani: कारांतें) in Goa where it is used widely in Goan cuisine. In Bengal, where it is known as korola (করলা) or ucche  (উচ্ছে) in Bengali, bitter melon is often simply eaten boiled and mashed with salt, mustard oil, sliced thinly and deep fried, added to lentils to make \"tetor\" dal (bitter lentils), and is a key ingredient of the Shukto, a Bengali vegetable medley that is a mixture of several vegetables like raw banana, drumstick stems, bori, and sweet potato. In northern India and Nepal, bitter melon, known as tite karela (तीते करेला) in Nepali, is prepared as a fresh pickle. For this, the vegetable is cut into cubes or slices, and sautéed with oil and a sprinkle of water. When it is softened and reduced, it is crushed in a mortar with a few cloves of garlic, salt, and a red or green pepper. It is also eaten sautéed to golden brown, stuffed, or as a curry on its own or with potatoes. In Burmese cuisine, bitter melon is sauteéd with garlic, tomatoes, spices, and dried shrimp and is served as an accompaniment to other dishes. Such a dish is available at street stalls and deli counters throughout the country. It is called karavila (Sinhala: කරවිල) in Sri Lanka and it is an ingredient in many different curry dishes (e.g., karawila curry and karawila sambol) which are served mainly with rice in a main meal. Sometimes large grated coconut pieces are added, which is more common in rural areas. Karawila juice is also sometimes served there. Bitter melon, known as gōyā (ゴーヤー) in Okinawan, and nigauri (苦瓜) in Japanese (although the Okinawan word gōyā is also used), is a significant ingredient in Okinawan cuisine, and is increasingly used in Japanese cuisine beyond that island. In Pakistan, where it is known as karela (کریلا) in Urdu-speaking areas, bitter melon is often cooked with onions, red chili powder, turmeric powder, salt, coriander powder, and a pinch of cumin seeds.  Another dish in Pakistan calls for whole, unpeeled bitter melon to be boiled and then stuffed with cooked minced beef, served with either hot tandoori bread, naan, chappati, or with khichri (a mixture of lentils and rice). In Indonesian cuisine, bitter melon, known as pare in Javanese and Indonesian (also paria), is prepared in various dishes, such as gado-gado, and also stir-fried, cooked in coconut milk, or steamed.  In Christian areas in Eastern Indonesia it is cooked with pork and chili, the sweetness of the pork balancing against the bitterness of the vegetable. In Vietnamese cuisine, raw bitter melon slices known as mướp đắng or khổ qua in Vietnamese, eaten with dried meat floss and bitter melon soup with shrimp, are common dishes. Bitter melons stuffed with ground pork are commonly served as a summer soup in the south. It is also used as the main ingredient of stewed bitter melon. This dish is usually cooked for the Tết holiday, where its \"bitter\" name is taken as a reminder of the bitter living conditions experienced in the past. In Thai cuisine, the Chinese variety of green bitter melon, mara (มะระ) in Thai, is prepared stuffed with minced pork and garlic, in a clear broth. It is also s",

    "content": "### Etymology\nThe English word calabash is loaned from Middle French: calebasse, which in turn derived from Spanish: calabaza meaning gourd or pumpkin. The Spanish word is of pre-Roman origin. It comes from the Iberian: calapaccu, from -cal which means house or shell. It is a doublet of carapace and galapago.[10][11][12] The English word is cognate with Catalan: carabassa (\"pumpkin; orange colour\"), Galician: cabaza (\"gourd, pumpkin, squash; calabash (container)\"), Occitan: calebasso, carabasso, carbasso, Portuguese: cabaça (\"gourd; calabash (container)\") and Sicilian: caravazza (and caramazza).[citation needed]\n\n### History\nThe bottle gourd has been recovered from archaeological contexts in China and Japan dating to c. 8,000–9,000 BP,[13] whereas in Africa, despite decades of high-quality archaeobotanical research, the earliest record of its occurrence remains the 1884 report of a bottle gourd being recovered from a 12th Dynasty tomb at Thebes dating to ca. 4,000 BP.[13] When considered together, the genetic and archaeological information points toward L. siceraria being independently brought under domestication first in Asia, and more than 4,000 years later, in Africa.[13]\nThe bottle gourd is a commonly cultivated plant in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, and was eventually domesticated in southern Africa. Stands of L. siceraria, which may be source plants and not merely domesticated stands, were reported in Zimbabwe in 2004.[14] This apparent wild plant produces thinner-walled fruit that, when dried, would not endure the rigors of use on long journeys as a water container. Today's gourd may owe its tough, waterproof wall to selection pressures over its long history of domestication.[15] Gourds were cultivated in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas for thousands of years before Columbus' arrival to the Americas. Polynesian specimens of calabash were found to have genetic markers suggesting hybridization from Asian and American cultivars.[16] In Europe,[17] Walahfrid Strabo (808–849), abbot and poet from Reichenau  and advisor to the Carolingian kings, discussed the gourd in his Hortulus as one of the 23 plants of an ideal garden.[18][19] The mystery of the bottle gourd – namely that this African or Eurasian species was being grown in the Americas over 8,000 years ago[20] – comes from the difficulty in understanding how it arrived in the Americas. The bottle gourd was theorized to have drifted across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to South America, but in 2005 a group of researchers suggested that it may have been domesticated earlier than food crops and livestock and, like dogs, was brought into the New World at the end of the ice age by the native hunter-gatherer Paleo-Indians, which they based on a study of the genetics of archaeological samples. This study purportedly showed that gourds in American archaeological finds were more closely related to Asian variants than to African ones.[8] In 2014 this theory was repudiated based on a more thorough genetic study. Researchers more completely examined the plastid genomes of a broad sample of bottle gourds, and concluded that North and South American specimens were most closely related to wild African variants and could have drifted over the ocean several or many times, as long as 10,000 years ago.[21]\n\n### Cultivation\nBottle gourds are grown by direct sowing of seeds or transplanting 15- to 20-day-old seedlings. The plant prefers well-drained, moist, organic rich soil. It requires plenty of moisture in the growing season and a warm, sunny position, sheltered from the wind. It can be cultivated in small places such as in a pot, and allowed to spread on a trellis or roof. In rural areas, many houses with thatched roofs are covered with the gourd vines. Bottle gourds grow very rapidly and their stems can reach a length of 9 m in the summer, so they need a solid support along the stem if they are to climb a pole or trellis. If planted under a tall tree, the vine may grow up to the top of the tree. To obtain more fruit, farmers sometimes cut off the tip of the vine when it has grown to 2 metres in length. This forces the plant to produce side branches that will bear flowers and yield more fruit. The plant produces night blooming white flowers. The male flowers have long peduncles and the females have short ones with an ovary in the shape of the fruit. Sometimes the female flowers drop off without growing into a gourd due to the failure of pollination if there is no night pollinator (probably a kind of moth) in the garden. Hand pollination can be used to solve the problem. Pollens are around 60 microns in length. First crop is ready for harvest within two months; first flowers open in about 45 days from sowing. Each plant can yield 1 fruit per day for the next 45 days if enough nutrients are available. Yield ranges from 35 to 40 tons/ha, per season of 3 months cycle.\n\n### Toxicity\nLike other members of the family Cucurbitaceae, gourds contain cucurbitacins that are known to be cytotoxic at a high concentration. The tetracyclic triterpenoid cucurbitacins present in fruits and vegetables of the cucumber family are responsible for the bitter taste, and could cause stomach ulcers. In extreme cases, people have died from drinking the juice of gourds.[22][23][24]\nThe toxic cases are usually due to the gourd being used to make juice, which the drinkers described as being unusually bitter.[25] In three of the lethal cases, the victims were diabetics in their 50s and 60s.[25] In 2018, a healthy woman in her 40s was hospitalized for severe reactions after consuming the juice and died three days later from complications.[26] The plant is not normally toxic when eaten. The excessively bitter (and toxic) gourds are due to improper storage (temperature swings or high temperature) and over-ripening.[25]\n\n### Nutrition\nBoiled calabash is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5 oz), cooked calabash supplies a moderate amount of vitamin C (10% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).\n\n### Central America\nIn Central America the seeds of the bottle gourd are toasted and ground with other ingredients (including rice, cinnamon, and allspice) to make one type of the drink horchata.\n\n### East Asia\nThe calabash is frequently used in southern Chinese cuisine in either a stir-fry dish or a soup. In Japan, it is commonly sold in the form of dried, marinated strips known as kanpyō and is used as an ingredient for making makizushi (rolled sushi). Traditionally in Korea, the inner flesh has been eaten as namul vegetable and the outside cut in half to make bowls. Both fresh and dried flesh of bak is used in Korean cuisine. Fresh calabash flesh, scraped out, seeded, salted and squeezed to draw out moisture, is called baksok. Scraped and sun-dried calabash flesh, called bak-goji, is usually soaked before being stir-fried. Soaked bak-goji is often simmered in sauce or stir-fried before being added to japchae and gimbap.[29][30] Sometimes uncooked raw baksok is seasoned to make saengchae.\n\n### Southeast Asia\nIn Burma, it is a popular fruit. The young leaves are also boiled and eaten with a spicy, fermented fish sauce. It can also be cut up, coated in batter and deep fried to make fritters, which are eaten with Burmese mohinga. In the Philippines, calabash (known locally as upo) is commonly cooked in soup dishes like tinola. They are also common ingredients in noodle (pancit) dishes. In Vietnam, it is a very popular vegetable, commonly cooked in soup with shrimp, meatballs, clams, various fish like freshwater catfish or snakehead fish or crab. It is also commonly stir-fried with meat or seafood, or incorporated as an ingredient of a hotpot. It is also used as a medicine. Americans have called calabashes from Vietnam \"opo squash\". The shoots, tendrils, and leaves of the plant may also be eaten as greens.\n\n### ",

    "title": "Pea",
    "content": "### Description\nA pea is a most commonly green, occasionally golden yellow,[6] or infrequently purple[7] pod-shaped vegetable, widely grown as a cool-season crop. The seeds may be planted as soon as the soil temperature reaches 10 °C (50 °F), with the plants growing best at temperatures of 13 to 18 °C (55 to 64 °F). They do not thrive in the summer heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates, but do grow well in cooler, high-elevation, tropical areas. Many cultivars reach maturity about 60 days after planting.[8] Peas have both low-growing and vining cultivars. The vining cultivars grow thin tendrils from leaves that coil around any available support and can climb to be 1 to 2 metres (3 to 7 ft) high. A traditional approach to supporting climbing peas is to thrust branches pruned from trees or other woody plants upright into the soil, providing a lattice for the peas to climb. Branches used in this fashion are called pea sticks[9] or sometimes pea brush. Metal fences, twine, or netting supported by a frame are used for the same purpose. In dense plantings, peas give each other some measure of mutual support. Pea plants can self-pollinate.[10]\n\n### Genome\nThe pea karyotype consists of seven chromosomes, five of which are acrocentric and two submetacentric.[11] Despite its scientific popularity, its relatively large genome size (4.45Gb) made it challenging to sequence compared to other legumes such as Medicago truncatula and soybeans. The International Pea Genome Sequencing Consortium was formed to develop the first pea reference genome, and the draft assembly was officially announced in September 2019. It covers 88% of the genome (3.92Gb) and predicted 44,791 gene-coding sequences. The pea used for the assembly was the inbred French cultivar \"Caméor\".[12] In 2022, a pea pangenome was published.[13]\n\n### Taxonomy\nCarl Linnaeus gave the species the scientific name Pisum sativum in 1753 (meaning cultivated pea). Some sources now treat it as Lathyrus oleraceus,[1][14] although the need and justification for this change is disputed.[15]\n\n### Etymology\nThe term pea originates from the Latin word pisum,[16] which is the latinisation of the Greek πίσον (pison), neuter variant form of πίσος (pisos) 'pea'.[17][18] It was adopted into English as the noun pease (plural peasen), as in pease pudding. However, by analogy with other plurals ending in -s, speakers began construing pease as a plural and constructing the singular form by dropping the -s, giving the term pea. This process is known as back-formation.[19]\n\n### Garden Peas\nThere are many varieties (cultivars) of garden peas. Some of the most common varieties are listed here. PMR indicates some degree of powdery mildew resistance; afila types, also called semi-leafless, have clusters of tendrils instead of leaves.[20] Unless otherwise noted these are so called dwarf varieties which grow to an average height of about 1 m. Giving the vines support is recommended, but not required. Extra dwarf are suitable for container growing, reaching only about 25 cm. Tall varieties grow to about 2 m with support required.[21]\n\n### Edible-Pod Peas\nSome peas lack the tough membrane inside the pod wall and have tender edible pods,[25] allowing them to be eaten whole. There are two main types:[26] The name sugar pea can include both types[25][27] or be synonymous with either snow peas or snap peas in different dictionaries.[28] The term mangetout (/ˈmɒ̃ʒˌtuː/; from French: pois mange-tout, 'eat-all pea') is generally used in British English to refer to the snow pea specifically,[29][30] but may also refer to a snap pea, especially when used in other contexts. Snow peas and snap peas both belong to Macrocarpon Group,[31][32] a cultivar group based on the variety Pisum sativum var. macrocarpum Ser. named in 1825.[33] It was described as having very compressed non-leathery edible pods in the original publication.\n\n### Field Peas\nThe field pea is a type of pea sometimes called Pisum sativum subsp. arvense (L.) Asch.  It is also known as dun (grey-brown) pea, Kapucijner pea, or Austrian winter pea, and is one of the oldest domesticated crops, cultivated for at least 7,000 years.  Field peas are now grown in many countries for both human consumption and stockfeed.  There are several cultivars and colors including blue, dun (brown), maple and white. This pea should not be confused with the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) which is sometimes called the \"field pea\" in warmer climates.[34][35] It is a climbing annual legume with weak, viny, and relatively succulent stems. Vines often are 120–150 cm (4–5 ft) long, but when grown alone, field pea's weak stems prevent it from growing more than 45–60 cm (1+1⁄2–2 ft) tall. Leaves have two leaflets and a tendril. Flowers are white, pink, or purple. Pods carry seeds that are large (seed densities of 8,800/kg or 4,000/lb), nearly spherical, and white, gray, green, or brown. The root system is relatively shallow and small, but well nodulated.[36] The field pea is a cool-season legume crop that is grown on over 10 million hectares (25 million acres) worldwide. It has been an important grain legume crop for millennia, seeds showing domesticated characteristics dating from at least 7,000 years ago have been found in archaeological sites around what is now Turkey.  Field peas or \"dry peas\" are marketed as a dry, shelled product for either human or livestock food, unlike the garden pea, which is marketed as a fresh or canned vegetable. The major producing countries of field peas are Russia and China, followed by Canada, Europe, Australia and the United States. Europe, Australia, Canada and the U.S. raise over 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) and are major exporters of peas. In 2002, there were approximately 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of field peas grown in the U.S.[37]\n\n### Distribution And Habitat\nThe wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean Basin and the Near East. The earliest archaeological finds of peas date from the late Neolithic era of current Syria, Anatolia, Israel, Iraq, Jordan and Greece.[38] In Egypt, early finds date from c. 4800–4400 BC in the Nile Delta area, and from c. 3800–3600 BC in Upper Egypt. In northern Europe, specifically Fennoscandia, findings of pea data back to 4000 BC.[39] The pea was also present in Georgia in the 5th millennium BC. Farther east, the finds are younger. Peas were present in Afghanistan c. 2000 BC, in Harappan civilization around modern-day Pakistan and western- and northwestern India in 2250–1750 BC. In the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, this legume crop appears in the Ganges Basin and southern India.[40]\n\n### History\nIn early times, peas were grown mostly for their dry seeds.[41] From plants growing wild in the Mediterranean Basin, constant selection since the Neolithic dawn of agriculture[42] improved their yield. Peas are mentioned in Aristophanes's The Birds. The Greeks and Romans were cultivating this legume from around 500 BC to 400 BC, with vendors in the streets of Athens selling hot pea soup.[43] In the early 3rd century BC, Theophrastus mentions peas among the legumes that are sown late in the winter because of their tenderness.[44] In the first and second centuries BC, Cato the Elder and Varro both mention peas in their respective works De agri cultura and De re rustica.[45] It is also mentioned frequently in de re coquinaria by Apicius and occurs in many different recipes. In the Middle Ages, field peas are constantly mentioned, as they were the staple that kept famine at bay, as Charles the Good, count of Flanders, noted explicitly in 1124.[46] Green \"garden\" peas, eaten immature and fresh, were an innovative luxury of Early Modern Europe. In England, the distinction between field peas and garden peas dates from the early 17th century: John Gerard and John Parkinson both mention garden peas.[citation needed] Snow and snap peas, which the French called mange-tout, because they were eaten pods and all, were intro",

    "title": "Capsicum",
    "content": "### History\nCapsicum is native to South America and Central America.[5] These plants have been evolving for 17 million years.[6] It was domesticated and cultivated at least since 3000 BC, as evidenced by remains of chili peppers found in pottery from Puebla and Oaxaca.[7]\n\n### Etymology And Names\nThe generic name may come from Latin capsa, meaning 'box', presumably alluding to the pods;[8][9] or possibly from the Greek word κάπτω, kapto, 'to gulp'.[10] The name pepper comes from the similarity of piquance (spiciness or \"heat\") of the flavor to that of black pepper, Piper nigrum, although there is no botanical relationship with it or with Sichuan pepper. The original term chilli came from the Nahuatl word chīlli, denoting a larger Capsicum variety cultivated at least since 3000 BC.[7] Different varieties were cultivated in South America, where they are known as ajíes (singular ají), from the Quechua term for Capsicum. The fruit (botanically a berry) of Capsicum plants has a variety of names depending on place and type. The more piquant varieties are called chili peppers, or simply chilis. The large, mild form is called bell pepper, or is named by color (green pepper, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, etc.) in North America. In South Africa and some other countries, it is called sweet pepper. The name is simply pepper in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[11] The name capsicum is used in Australia, India, Malaysia, and New Zealand.[12]\n\n### Phylogeny\nCapsicums are solanaceous plants within the tribe Capsiceae, and are closely related to Lycianthes.[13] A 2020 study using ribosomal DNA provided the following phylogenetic tree. It can be seen that in two of the clades, the species C. frutescens is intermingled with C. eximium in one subclade and C. chinense in another subclade; and that C. chacoense is intermingled with C. baccatum.[14] C. annuum inc. many varieties C. frutescens (in part) and C. eximium C. chinense and C. frutescens (in part) C. baccatum (in part) C. chacoense (in part) C. baccatum (in part) C. chacoense (in part) C. pubescens inc. Chile de caballo C. eximium, a pungent chili pepper with purple flowers C. lycianthoides\n\n### Growing Conditions\nIdeal growing conditions for peppers include a sunny position with warm, loamy soil, ideally 21 to 29 °C (70 to 84 °F), that is moist but not waterlogged.[15] Extremely moist soils can cause seedlings to \"damp-off\" and reduce germination.[citation needed] The plants will tolerate (but do not like) temperatures down to 12 °C (54 °F) and they are sensitive to cold.[16][17] For flowering, Capsicum is a non-photoperiod-sensitive crop.[18] The flowers can self-pollinate. However, at extremely high temperature, 30 to 38 °C (86 to 100 °F), pollen loses viability, and flowers are much less likely to result in fruit.[19]\n\n### Species And Varieties\nCapsicum consists of 20–27 species,[20] five of which are widely cultivated: C. annuum, C. baccatum, C. chinense, C. frutescens, and C. pubescens.[21] Phylogenetic relationships between species have been investigated using biogeographical,[22] morphological,[23] chemosystematic,[24] hybridization,[25] and genetic[20] data.  Fruits of Capsicum can vary tremendously in color, shape, and size both between and within species, which has led to confusion over the relationships among taxa.[26] Chemosystematic studies helped distinguish the difference between varieties and species. For example, C. baccatum var. baccatum had the same flavonoids as C. baccatum var. pendulum, which led researchers to believe the two groups belonged to the same species.[24] Many varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways; for example, C. annuum includes the \"bell pepper\" variety, which is sold in both its immature green state and in its red, yellow, or orange ripe state. This same species has other varieties, as well, such as the Anaheim chiles often used for stuffing, the dried ancho (before being dried it is called a poblano) chile used to make chili powder, the mild-to-hot, ripe jalapeno used to make smoked jalapeno, known as chipotle.[27] Peru is thought to be the country with the highest cultivated Capsicum diversity since varieties of all five domesticates are commonly sold in markets in contrast to other countries. Bolivia is considered to be the country where the largest diversity of wild Capsicum peppers are consumed. Bolivian consumers distinguish two basic forms: ulupicas, species with small round fruits including C. eximium, C. cardenasii, C. eshbaughii, and C. caballeroi landraces; and arivivis, with small elongated fruits including C. baccatum var. baccatum and C. chacoense varieties.[28] The amount of capsaicin is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU) and this value varies significantly among Capsicum varieties. For example, a typical Bell pepper has a value of zero SHU and a Jalapeño has a value of 4000–8000 SHU. In 2017, the Guinness Book of World Records listed the Carolina Reaper as the world's hottest pepper at 1,641,183 SHU, according to tests conducted by Winthrop University in South Carolina, United States. In 2023, the Guinness Book of Records recognized Pepper X as the world's hottest pepper.[29]\n\n### Species List\nSources:[30][31] According to Adepoju et al. (2021), the most commonly occurring Capsicum cultivars in Nigeria (and West Africa) are: C. fructescens var. fructescens L.; C. fructescens var. baccatum (L.) Irish; C. annuum var annuum L; C. annuum var. grossum (L.) Sendtn. and C. chinense Jacq.[32]\n\n### Genetics\nMost Capsicum species are 2n=2x=24. A few of the non-domesticated species are 2n=2x=26.[33] All are diploid. The Capsicum annuum and Capsicum chinense genomes were completed in 2014. The Capsicum annuum genome is approximately 3.48 Gb, making it larger than the human genome. Over 75% of the pepper genome is composed of transposable elements, mostly Gypsy elements, distributed widely throughout the genome. The distribution of transposable elements is inversely correlated with gene density. Pepper is predicted to have 34,903 genes, approximately the same number as both tomato and potato, two related species within the family Solanaceae.[34]\n\n### Breeding\nMany types of peppers have been bred for heat, size, and yield. Along with selection of specific fruit traits such as flavor and color, specific pest, disease and abiotic stress resistances are continually being selected. Breeding occurs in several environments dependent on the use of the final variety including but not limited to: conventional, organic, hydroponic, green house and shade house production environments. Several breeding programs are being conducted by corporations and universities. In the United States, New Mexico State University has released several varieties in the last few years.[35] Cornell University has worked to develop regionally adapted varieties that work better in cooler, damper climates. Other universities such as UC Davis, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Oregon State University have smaller breeding programs. Many vegetable seed companies breed different types of peppers as well.\n\n### Capsaicin\nThe fruit of most species of Capsicum contains capsaicin (methyl-n-vanillyl nonenamide), a lipophilic chemical that can produce a burning sensation (pungency or spiciness) in the mouth of the eater. Most mammals find this unpleasant, whereas birds are unaffected.[36][37] The secretion of capsaicin protects the fruit from consumption by insects.[38] Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes, and to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in this genus. The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith around the seeds.[39] Most of the capsaicin in a pungent (hot) pepper is concentrated in blisters on the epidermis of the interior ribs (septa) that divide the chambers, or locules, of the f",

    "content": "### Evolutionary History\nThe large citrus fruit of today evolved originally from small, edible berries over millions of years. Citrus species began to diverge from a common ancestor about 15 million years ago, at about the same time that Severinia (such as the Chinese box orange) diverged from the same ancestor. About 7 million years ago, the ancestors of Citrus split into the main genus, Citrus, and the Poncirus group (such as the trifoliate orange), which some taxonomies consider a separate genus and others include in Citrus[4] Poncirus\nis closely enough related that it can still be hybridized with all other citrus and used as rootstock. These estimates are made using genetic mapping of plant chloroplasts.[5] A DNA study published in Nature in 2018 concludes that the genus Citrus evolved in the foothills of the Himalayas, in the area of Assam (India), western Yunnan (China), and northern Myanmar.[6] The three ancestral species in the genus Citrus associated with modern Citrus cultivars are the mandarin orange, pomelo, and citron. Almost all of the common commercially important citrus fruits (sweet oranges, lemons, grapefruit, limes, and so on) are hybrids between these three species, their main progenies, and other wild Citrus species within the last few thousand years.[8][9][10] Citrus plants are native to subtropical and tropical regions of Asia, Island Southeast Asia, Near Oceania, and northeastern and central Australia. Domestication of citrus species involved much hybridization and introgression, leaving much uncertainty about when and where domestication first happened.[8] A genomic, phylogenic, and biogeographical analysis by Wu et al. (2018) has shown that the center of origin of the genus Citrus is likely the southeast foothills of the Himalayas, in a region stretching from eastern Assam, northern Myanmar, to western Yunnan. It diverged from a common ancestor with Poncirus trifoliata. A change in climate conditions during the Late Miocene (11.63 to 5.33 mya) resulted in a sudden speciation event. The species resulting from this event include the citrons (Citrus medica) of South Asia; the pomelos (C. maxima) of Mainland Southeast Asia; the mandarins (C. reticulata), kumquats (C. japonica), mangshanyegan (C. mangshanensis), and ichang papedas (C. cavaleriei) of southeastern China; the kaffir limes (C. hystrix) of Island Southeast Asia; and the biasong and samuyao (C. micrantha) of the Philippines.[8][7] This was followed by the spread of citrus species into Taiwan and Japan in the Early Pliocene (5.33 to 3.6 mya), resulting in the tachibana orange (C. tachibana); and beyond the Wallace Line into Papua New Guinea and Australia during the Early Pleistocene (2.5 million to 800,000 years ago), where further speciation events created the Australian limes.[8][7]\n\n### Fossil Record\nA fossil leaf from the Pliocene of Valdarno, Italy is described as †Citrus meletensis.[11]\nIn China, fossil leaf specimens of †Citrus linczangensis have been collected from late Miocene coal-bearing strata of the Bangmai Formation in Yunnan province. C. linczangensis resembles C. meletensis in having an intramarginal vein, an entire margin, and an articulated and distinctly winged petiole.[12]\n\n### Taxonomy\nMany cultivated Citrus species are natural or artificial hybrids of a small number of core ancestral species, including the citron, pomelo, and mandarin. Natural and cultivated citrus hybrids include commercially important fruit such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, and some tangerines. The multiple hybridisations have made the taxonomy of Citrus complex.[13][14] Kumquats and Clymenia spp. are now generally considered to belong within the genus Citrus.[15] The false oranges, Oxanthera from New Caledonia, have been transferred to the Citrus genus on phylogenetic evidence.[16][17] A recent taxonomy reincorporates the trifoliate orange (Poncirus) into an enlarged Citrus, but recognizes that many botanists still follow Swingle in splitting it off.[4]\n\n### History\nThe earliest introductions of citrus species by human migrations was during the Austronesian expansion (c. 3000–1500 BCE), where Citrus hystrix, Citrus macroptera, and Citrus maxima were among the canoe plants carried by Austronesian voyagers eastwards into Micronesia and Polynesia.[18] The citron (Citrus medica) was also introduced early into the Mediterranean basin from India and Southeast Asia, via two ancient trade routes: an overland route through Persia, the Levant and the Mediterranean islands, and a maritime route through the Arabian Peninsula and Ptolemaic Egypt into North Africa. Although the exact date of the original introduction is unknown due to the sparseness of archaeobotanical remains, the earliest evidence is seeds recovered from the Hala Sultan Tekke site of Cyprus, dated to around 1200 BCE. Other archaea botanical evidence includes pollen from Carthage, dating back to the 4th century BCE, and carbonized seeds from Pompeii dated to around the 3rd to 2nd century BCE. The earliest complete description of the citron was written by Theophrastus, c. 310 BCE.[19][20][21] Lemons, pomelos, and sour oranges were introduced to the Mediterranean by Arab traders around the 10th century CE. Sweet oranges were brought to Europe by the Genoese and Portuguese from Asia during the 15th to 16th century. Mandarins were not introduced until the 19th century.[19][20][21] Oranges were introduced to Florida by Spanish colonists.[22][23]  In cooler parts of Europe, citrus fruit was grown in orangeries starting in the 17th century; many were as much status symbols as functional agricultural structures.[24]\n\n### Etymology\nThe generic name Citrus originates from Latin, where it denoted either the citron (C. medica) or a conifer tree (Thuja). The Latin word is related to the ancient Greek word for the cedar of Lebanon, κέδρος (kédros), perhaps from a perceived similarity of the smell of citrus leaves and fruit with that of cedar.[25]\n\n### Tree\nCitrus plants are large shrubs or small to moderate-sized trees, reaching 5–15 m (16–49 ft) tall, with spiny shoots and alternately arranged evergreen leaves with an entire margin.[26] The flowers are solitary or in small corymbs, each flower 2–4 cm (0.79–1.57 in) diameter, with five (rarely four) white petals and numerous stamens; they are often very strongly scented, due to the presence of essential oil glands.[27]\n\n### Fruit\nThe fruit is a hesperidium, a specialised berry with multiple carpels, globose to elongated,[27][28] 4–30 cm (1.6–11.8 in) long and 4–20 cm (1.6–7.9 in) diameter, with a leathery rind or \"peel\" called a pericarp. The outermost layer of the pericarp is an \"exocarp\" called the flavedo, commonly referred to as the zest. The middle layer of the pericarp is the mesocarp, which in citrus fruits consists of the white, spongy albedo or pith. The innermost layer of the pericarp is the endocarp. This surrounds a variable number of carpels, shaped as radial segments. The seeds, if present, develop inside the carpels. The space inside each segment is a locule filled with juice vesicles, or pulp. From the endocarp, string-like \"hairs\" extend into the locules, which provide nourishment to the fruit as it develops.[27][29] The genus is commercially important with cultivars of many species grown for their fruit. Some cultivars have been developed to be easy to peel and seedless, meaning they are parthenocarpic.[28] The fragrance of citrus fruits is conferred by flavonoids and limonoids in the rind. The flavonoids include various flavanones and flavones.[30] The carpels are juicy; they contain a high quantity of citric acid, which with other organic acids including ascorbic acid (vitamin C) give them their characteristic sharp taste.[31] Citrus fruits are diverse in size and shape, as well as in color and flavor, reflecting their biochemistry;[32][33] for instance, grapefruit is made bitter-tasting by a flavanone, naringin.[31]\n\n### Cultivation\nMost commercial citrus ",

    "content": "### Description\nThe orange tree is a relatively small evergreen, flowering tree, with an average height of 9 to 10 m (30 to 33 ft), although some very old specimens can reach 15 m (49 ft).[1] Its oval leaves, which are alternately arranged, are 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in) long and have crenulate margins.[2] Sweet oranges grow in a range of different sizes, and shapes varying from spherical to oblong. Inside and attached to the rind is a porous white tissue, the white, bitter mesocarp or albedo (pith).[3] The orange contains a number of distinct carpels (segments or pigs, botanically the fruits) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by a membrane and containing many juice-filled vesicles and usually a few pips. When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet orange is non-climacteric, not ripening off the tree. The Citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.[4][5][6] The fruit is a hesperidium, a modified berry; it is covered by a rind formed by a rugged thickening of the ovary wall.[7][8]\n\n### Hybrid Origins\nCitrus trees are angiosperms, and most species are almost entirely interfertile. This includes grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and many citrus hybrids. As the interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have also been selected, citrus taxonomy has proven difficult.[9] The sweet orange, Citrus x sinensis,[10] is not a wild fruit, but arose in domestication in East Asia. It originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India,[11] and Myanmar.[12]\nThe fruit was created as a cross between a non-pure mandarin orange and a hybrid pomelo that had a substantial mandarin component.[13][14] Since its chloroplast DNA is that of pomelo, it was likely the hybrid pomelo, perhaps a pomelo BC1 backcross, that was the maternal parent of the first orange.[15][16] Based on genomic analysis, the relative proportions of the ancestral species in the sweet orange are approximately 42% pomelo and 58% mandarin.[17] All varieties of the sweet orange descend from this prototype cross, differing only by mutations selected for during agricultural propagation.[16] Sweet oranges have a distinct origin from the bitter orange, which arose independently, perhaps in the wild, from a cross between pure mandarin and pomelo parents.[16] Sweet oranges have in turn given rise to many further hybrids including the grapefruit, which arose from a sweet orange x pomelo backcross. Spontaneous and engineered backcrosses between the sweet orange and mandarin oranges or tangerines have produced the clementine and murcott. The ambersweet is a complex sweet orange x (Orlando tangelo x clementine) hybrid.[17][18] The citranges are a group of sweet orange x trifoliate orange (Citrus trifoliata) hybrids.[19]\n\n### Arab Agricultural Revolution\nIn Europe, the Moors introduced citrus fruits including the bitter orange, lemon, and lime to Al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula during the Arab Agricultural Revolution.[20] Large-scale cultivation started in the 10th century, as evidenced by complex irrigation techniques specifically adapted to support orange orchards.[21][20] Citrus fruits—among them the bitter orange—were introduced to Sicily in the 9th century during the period of the Emirate of Sicily, but the sweet orange was unknown there until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and Portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the Mediterranean area.[11]\n\n### Spread Across Europe\nShortly afterward, the sweet orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit. It was considered a luxury food grown by wealthy people in private conservatories, called orangeries. By 1646, the sweet orange was well known throughout Europe; it went on to become the most often cultivated of all fruit trees.[11] Louis XIV of France had a great love of orange trees and built the grandest of all royal Orangeries at the Palace of Versailles.[22] At Versailles, potted orange trees in solid silver tubs were placed throughout the rooms of the palace, while the Orangerie allowed year-round cultivation of the fruit to supply the court. When Louis condemned his finance minister, Nicolas Fouquet, in 1664, part of the treasures that he confiscated were over 1,000 orange trees from Fouquet's estate at Vaux-le-Vicomte.[23]\n\n### To The Americas\nSpanish travelers introduced the sweet orange to the American continent. On his second voyage in 1493, Christopher Columbus may have planted the fruit on Hispaniola.[6] Subsequent expeditions in the mid-1500s brought sweet oranges to South America and Mexico, and to Florida in 1565, when Pedro Menéndez de Avilés founded St Augustine. Spanish missionaries brought orange trees to Arizona between 1707 and 1710, while the Franciscans did the same in San Diego, California, in 1769.[11] Archibald Menzies, the botanist on the Vancouver Expedition, collected orange seeds in South Africa, raised the seedlings on board, and gave them to several Hawaiian chiefs in 1792. The sweet orange came to be grown across the Hawaiian Islands, but its cultivation stopped after the arrival of the Mediterranean fruit fly in the early 1900s.[11][24] Florida farmers obtained seeds from New Orleans around 1872, after which orange groves were established by grafting the sweet orange on to sour orange rootstocks.[11] Citrus cultivation in California began with the Spanish missionaries, who planted oranges and lemons at Baja California around 1739 and at Alta California missions by 1769. Early fruit was thick-skinned and sour, not suited for commercial markets.  The first sizable grove was established at Mission San Gabriel in 1804, with about 400 trees on six acres. This mission-based agriculture ended with secularization which closed the missions and gave away their lands in 1835. Jean-Louis Vignes likely planted the first private orange grove in Los Angeles in 1834.  William Wolfskill planted his orchard in Los Angeles in 1841. By 1862, his orchards held two-thirds of the state's orange trees. The California gold rush (from 1849) increased demand for oranges, especially for their vitamin C, which helped prevent scurvy among miners. This spurred gradual expansion of orchards. In the early 1870s, Wolfskill's reported profits of $1,000 per acre attracted Midwestern farmers to citrus growing, especially in Orange County.[25][26] The 1870s saw the introduction of improved fruit varieties. In 1873, navel orange plants from Brazil were distributed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Luther C. Tibbets and Eliza Tibbets successfully cultivated these in Riverside, leading to widespread planting of the sweet, seedless navel orange, which became the backbone of the California citrus industry.  The Valencia orange, introduced in 1876, matured in summer and fall, complementing the winter-ripening navel and providing oranges year-round.  The completion of major railroads (Southern Pacific in 1877, and the Santa Fe in 1885) and the introduction of ventilated boxcars revolutionized distribution, opening national markets and triggering a planting frenzy in southern California.  By 1885, the number of citrus trees in California had grown from 90,000 (in 1875) to 2 million, and to 4.5 million by 1901.[27][28] The 1890s brought pest control advances (spraying, fumigation) and frost protection (heaters, later wind machines).  The University of California established its Citrus Experiment Station in 1907, supporting research and innovation.  Cooperative marketing emerged with the formation of the California Fruit Growers Exchange in 1905, later known as Sunkist Growers Inc., which helped standardi",

    "content": "### Description\nThe lemon tree produces a pointed oval yellow fruit. Botanically this is a hesperidium, a modified berry with a tough, leathery rind. The rind is divided into an outer colored layer or zest, which is aromatic with essential oils, and an inner layer of white spongy pith. Inside are multiple carpels arranged as radial segments. The seeds develop inside the carpels. The space inside each segment is a locule filled with juice vesicles.[2] Lemons contain many phytochemicals, including polyphenols, terpenes, and tannins.[3] Their juice contains slightly more citric acid than lime juice (about 47 g/L), nearly twice as much as grapefruit juice, and about five times as much as orange juice.[4]\n\n### Origins\nThe lemon, like many other cultivated Citrus species, is a hybrid, in its case of the citron and the bitter orange.[5][6] Lemons were most likely first grown in northwest India.[7] The origin of the word lemon may be Middle Eastern.[7] The word draws from the Old French limon, then Italian limone, from the Arabic ليمون laymūn or līmūn, and from the Persian لیمو līmūn, a generic term for citrus fruit, which is a cognate of Sanskrit (nimbū, 'lime').[8] Lemons entered Europe near southern Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient Rome.[7] They were later introduced to Persia and then to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD.[7] The lemon was first recorded in literature in a 10th-century Arabic treatise on farming; it was used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens.[7] It was distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region in the Arab Agricultural Revolution between 1000 and 1150.[7] A section on lemon and lime tree cultivation in Andalusia, Spain, was included in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Kitāb al-Filāha (\"Book on Agriculture\").[9] The first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th century. It was introduced to the Americas in 1493, when Christopher Columbus brought lemon seeds to Hispaniola on his voyages. Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds, part of the Columbian exchange of plants between the Old and New Worlds. It was mainly used as an ornamental plant and for medicine.[7] In the 19th century, lemons were increasingly planted in Florida and California.[7] In 1747, the English physician James Lind's experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known as an important dietary ingredient.[7][10]\n\n### Growing And Pruning\nLemons need a minimum temperature of around 7 °C (45 °F), so they are not hardy year-round in temperate climates, but become hardier as they mature.[11] Citrus require minimal pruning by trimming overcrowded branches, with the tallest branch cut back to encourage bushy growth.[11] Throughout summer, pinching back tips of the most vigorous growth assures more abundant canopy development. As mature plants may produce unwanted, fast-growing shoots (called \"water shoots\"), these are removed from the main branches at the bottom or middle of the plant.[11] There is reputed merit in the tradition of urinating near a lemon tree.[12][13] In cultivation in the UK, the cultivars \"Meyer\"[14] and \"Variegata\"[15] have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).[16]\n\n### Production\nmillions of tonnes In 2022, world production of lemons (combined with limes for reporting) was 22 million tonnes led by India with 18% of the total. Mexico and China were major secondary producers (table).[17]\n\n### Varieties\nThe 'Bonnie Brae' is oblong, smooth, thin-skinned, and seedless.[18] These are mostly grown in San Diego County, California, United States.[19] The 'Eureka' grows year-round and abundantly. This is the common supermarket lemon, also known as \"Four Seasons\" (Quatre Saisons) because of its ability to produce fruit and flowers together throughout the year. This variety is also available as a plant for domestic customers.[20] There is also a pink-fleshed Eureka lemon with a green and yellow variegated outer skin.[21] The Lisbon lemon is very similar to the Eureka and is the other common supermarket lemon. It is smoother than the Eureka, has thinner skin, and has fewer or no seeds. It generally produces more juice than the Eureka.[22][23] The 'Femminello St. Teresa', or 'Sorrento' originates in Italy. This fruit's zest is high in lemon oils. It is the variety traditionally used in the making of limoncello.[24] The 'Yen Ben' is an Australasian cultivar.[25]\n\n### Nutrition\nLemon is a rich source of vitamin C, providing 64% of the Daily Value in a 100 g reference amount (table). Other essential nutrients are low in content.\n\n### Culinary\nLemon juice and rind are used in a wide variety of foods and drinks, the juice for its sour taste, from its content of 5–6% citric acid.[28] The whole lemon is used to make marmalade,[29] lemon curd[30] and lemon liqueurs such as Limoncello.[31] Lemon slices and lemon rind are used as a garnish for food and drinks. Lemon zest, the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add flavor to baked goods.[32] The juice is used to make lemonade[33] and some cocktails.[34] It is used in marinades for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish.[35] In meat, the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing it.[36] In the United Kingdom, lemon juice is frequently added to pancakes eaten to celebrate Shrove Tuesday.[37] Lemon juice is used as a short-term preservative on certain foods that tend to oxidize and turn brown after being sliced (enzymatic browning), such as apples, bananas, and avocados: its acidity suppresses oxidation by polyphenol oxidase enzymes.[38] Lemon peel is used in the manufacture of pectin, a gelling agent and stabilizer in food and other products.[39] In Mediterranean countries including Morocco, lemons are preserved in jars or barrels of salt. The salt penetrates the peel and rind, softening them, and curing them so that they last almost indefinitely.[40] Lemon oil is extracted from oil-containing cells in the skin. A machine breaks up the cells and uses a water spray to flush off the oil. The oil–water mixture is then filtered and separated by centrifugation.[41] The leaves of the lemon tree are used to make a tea and for preparing cooked meats and seafoods.[42]\n\n### Other Uses\nLemons were the primary commercial source of citric acid before the development of fermentation-based processes.[43]\nLemon oil is used in aromatherapy. Lemon oil aroma does not influence the human immune system,[44] but may contribute to relaxation.[45]\nAn educational science experiment involves attaching electrodes to a lemon and using it as a battery to produce electricity. Although very low power, several lemon batteries can power a small digital watch.[46] \nLemon juice forms a simple invisible ink, developed by heat.[47]\nLemon juice is sometimes used to increase the blonde color of hair, acting as a natural highlight after the moistened hair is exposed to sunlight. This works because citric acid acts as bleach.[48][49]\n\n### In Art And Culture\nLemons appear in paintings, pop art, and novels.[52] A wall painting in the tomb of Nakht in 15th century BC Egypt depicts a woman in a festival, holding a lemon. In the 17th century, Giovanna Garzoni painted a Still Life with Bowl of Citrons, the fruits still attached to leafy flowering twigs, with a wasp on one of the fruits. The impressionist Edouard Manet depicted a lemon on a pewter plate. In modern art, Arshile Gorky painted Still Life with Lemons in the 1930s.[52] In India, a lemon may be ritually encircled around a person in the belief that it repels negative energies.[53] It is a common practice for Hindu owners of a new car to drive over four lemons, one under each wheel, crushing them during their first drive. This is believed to protect the driver from accidents.[54] Hindu deities are sometimes depic",

    "content": "### History\nThe Middle East is generally described as the homeland of grapes and the cultivation of this plant began there 6,000–8,000 years ago.[1][2] Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the discovery of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.[3][4][5] The oldest known winery, the Areni-1 winery, was found in Armenia and dates back to around 4000 BC.[6] By the 9th century AD, the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.[7] Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes, and history attests to the ancient Greeks, Cypriots, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for eating and wine production.[8] The growing of grapes would later spread to other regions in Europe, North Africa, and eventually in North America. In 2005, a team of archaeologists concluded that Chalcolithic wine jars discovered in Cyprus in the 1930s dated back to 3500 BC, making them the oldest of their kind in the world.[9] Commandaria, a sweet dessert wine from Cyprus, is the oldest manufactured wine in the world with origins as far back as 2000 BC.[10] In North America, native grapes belonging to various species of the genus Vitis proliferate in the wild across the continent and were a part of the diet of many Native Americans, but early European colonists considered them to be unsuitable for wine. In the 19th century, Ephraim Bull of Concord, Massachusetts, cultivated seeds from wild Vitis labrusca vines to create the Concord grape, which would become an important agricultural crop in the United States.[11]\n\n### Description\nGrapes are a type of berry fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300. The berries appear within a 60 day period after fertilization first producing tartaric acid, then later malic acid when their flesh increases in reaction to the hormone of ethylene; these acids give slight sour tastes to the berries other than their sweetness.[14]: 2–3  When these young berries reach a ripening stage (called véraison from the French language), the berries change to darker colours, increase in size and produce sugars; this véraison period begins in August taking around about 45 days with normal conditions in the Northern Hemisphere.[14]: 3  Ripe grape berries are typically ellipsoid in shape resembling a prolate spheroid. Their flesh has 75-85% water content; the water is obtained from the plant xylem before ripening, the phloem supplies water with soluble sugars glucose and fructose following the ripening stage.[14]: 4–5 Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in the grape berries and red wines they produce.[15][16] Various grapes ripen can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. \"White\" grapes are actually green in color and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.[17]\n\n### Nutrition\nRaw grapes are 81% water, 18% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and have negligible fat (table). A 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference amount of raw grapes supplies 288 kilojoules (69 kilocalories) of food energy and a moderate amount of vitamin K (12% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).\n\n### Grapevines\nMost domesticated grapes come from cultivars of Vitis vinifera, a grapevine native to the Mediterranean and Central Asia. Minor amounts of fruit and wine come from American and Asian species such as:\n\n### Distribution Of Agriculture\nIn 2023, the world total of land dedicated to grape growing (in hectares, ha) was 6,595,680 ha (16,298,300 acres).[19] By country dedicating farmland for grape growing in 2023, Spain had 913,000 ha (2,260,000 acres), France 753,340 ha (1,861,500 acres), Italy 713,350 ha (1,762,700 acres), and China 607,030 ha (1,500,000 acres).[19] Approximately 71% of world grape production is used for wine, 27% as fresh fruit, and 2% as dried fruit.[citation needed] There are no reliable statistics that break down grape production by variety. It is believed that the most widely planted variety is Sultana, also known as Thompson Seedless, with at least 3,600 km2 (880,000 acres) dedicated to it. The second most common variety is Airén. Other popular varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Grenache, Tempranillo, Riesling, and Chardonnay.[20]\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of grapes was 72.5 million tonnes, led by China with 19% of the total, with Italy and France as major secondary producers (table).\n\n### Exports\nIn 2023, the leading exporters of grapes were Peru and Chile, each with more than half a million tonnes (table).\n\n### Table And Wine Grapes\nCommercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make wine (wine grapes). The sweetness of grapes depends on when they are harvested, as they do not continue to ripen once picked.[22] While almost all belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Grapes accumulate sugars as they grow on the grapevine through the transportation of sucrose molecules that are produced by photosynthesis from the leaves. During ripening the sucrose molecules are hydrolyzed (separated) into glucose and fructose. Wine grapes tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced \"100% grape juice\", made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.[23]\n\n### Seedless Grapes\nSeedless cultivars now make up the overwhelming majority of table grape plantings. Because grapevines are vegetatively propagated by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. It is an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent or rescue embryos early in development using tissue culture techniques. There are several sources of the seedlessness trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: Thompson Seedless, Russian Seedless, and Black Monukka, all being cultivars of Vitis vinifera.[citation needed] There are currently more than a dozen varieties of seedless grapes. Several, such as Einset Seedless, Benjamin Gunnels's Prime seedless grapes, Reliance, and Venus, have been specifically cultivated for hardiness and quality in the relatively cold climates of northeastern United States and southern Ontario.[24] An offset to the improved eating quality of seedlessness is the loss of potential health benefits provided by the enriched phytochemical content of grape seeds (see Health claims, below).[25][26]\n\n### Culinary\nGrapes are eaten raw, dried (as raisins, currants and sultanas), or cooked. Also, depending on the grape cultivar, grapes are used in winemaking. Grapes can be processed into a multitude of products such as jams, juices, vinegars and oils.\nCommercially cultivated grapes are classified as either table or wine grapes. These categories are based on their intended method of consumption: grapes that are eaten raw (table grapes), or grapes that are used to make wine (wine gra",

    "explanation": "### History\nThe Middle East is generally described as the homeland of grapes and the cultivation of this plant began there 6,000–8,000 years ago.[1][2] Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the discovery of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.[3][4][5] The oldest known winery, the Areni-1 winery, was fou",

    "content": "### Common Names\nMost of the common names of Manilkara zapota like \"sapodilla\", \"chiku\", and \"chicozapote\" come from Spanish meaning \"little sapote\".[6]: 515  Other common names in English include bully tree, soapapple tree, sawo, marmalade plum[9] and dilly tree.[10] The specific epithet zapota is from the Spanish zapote [saˈpote], which ultimately derives from the Nahuatl word tzapotl used for other similar looking fruits.[6]: 519, 521\n\n### Description\nA sapodilla tree can live up to one hundred years.[11][12] It can grow to more than 30 m (98 ft) tall with a trunk diameter of up to 1.5 m (5 ft); but the average height of cultivated specimens is usually between 9 and 15 m (30 and 49 ft) with a trunk diameter not exceeding 50 cm (20 in).[13] It is wind-resistant and the bark is rich in a white, gummy latex called chicle. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate 6–15 cm (2–6 in) long with entire margins on 1–3 cm (0–1 in) long petioles; they are medium green and glossy with brown and slightly furry midribs. They are arranged alternately.[14] The trees can survive only in warm, typically tropical environments (although it has low tolerance to drought and heat in its early years),[15] dying easily if the temperature drops below freezing. From germination, the sapodilla tree will usually take anywhere from five to eight years to bear fruit. The sapodilla trees yield fruit twice a year, though flowering may continue year round.[16] The white flowers are inconspicuous and bell-like, with a six-lobed corolla.\n\n### Fruit\nThe fruit is a large berry, 4–8 cm (2–3 in) in diameter.[14][17] An unripe fruit has a firm outer skin and when picked, releases white latex (chicle) from its stem. A fully ripened fruit has saggy skin and does not release chicle when picked. Inside, its flesh ranges from a pale yellow to an earthy brown color with a grainy texture akin to that of a well-ripened pear. Each fruit contains one to six seeds.[17] The seeds are hard, glossy, and black, resembling beans, with a hook at one end that can catch in the throat if swallowed. The ripe fruit has an exceptionally sweet, malty flavor. The unripe fruit is hard to the touch and contains high amounts of saponin, which has astringent properties similar to tannin, drying out the mouth.[citation needed]\n\n### Biological Studies\nCompounds extracted from the leaves showed anti-diabetic, antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic (cholesterol-lowering) effects in rats.[18] Acetone extracts of the seeds exhibited in vitro antibacterial effects against strains of Pseudomonas oleovorans and Vibrio cholerae.[19]\n\n### Synonyms\nSynonyms of this species include:[20]\n\n### Uses\nThe fruit is edible and a favorite in the tropical Americas.[21] Chicle from the bark is used to make chewing gum.",
