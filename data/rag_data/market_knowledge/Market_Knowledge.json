    "content": "Q: What is benefit-cost ratio?\nA: Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) = Gross Returns / Total Cost. If BCR > 1, farming is profitable. Example: Total cost Rs.50,000, Yield 50 quintals, Price Rs.2000/quintal, Gross return Rs.1,00,000. BCR = 100000/50000 = 2.0. A BCR of 2 means Rs.2 return for every Rs.1 invested. Higher BCR = better profitability.",
