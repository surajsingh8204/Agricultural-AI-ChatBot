    "content": "### History\nPrecision agriculture is a key component of the third wave of modern agricultural revolutions.  The first agricultural revolution was the increase of mechanized agriculture, from 1900 to 1930. Each farmer produced enough food to feed about 26 people during this time.[15] The 1960s prompted the Green Revolution with new methods of genetic modification, which led to each farmer feeding about 156 people.[15] It is expected that by 2050, the global population will reach about 9.6 billion, and food production must effectively double from current levels in order to feed every mouth. With new technological advancements in the agricultural revolution of precision farming, each farmer will be able to feed 265 people on the same acreage.[15]\n\n### Overview\nThe first wave of the precision agricultural revolution came in the forms of satellite and aerial imagery, weather prediction, variable rate fertilizer application, and crop health indicators.[16] The second wave aggregates the machine data for even more precise planting, topographical mapping, and soil data.[17] Precision agriculture aims to optimize field-level management with regard to: Precision agriculture also provides farmers with a wealth of information to:\n\n### Prescriptive Planting\nPrescriptive planting is a type of farming system that delivers data-driven planting advice that can determine variable planting rates to accommodate varying conditions across a single field, in order to maximize yield. It has been described as \"Big Data on the farm.\" Monsanto, DuPont and others are launching this technology in the US.[18][19]\n\n### Principles\nPrecision agriculture uses many tools, but some of the basics include tractors, combines, sprayers, planters, and diggers, which are all considered auto-guidance systems. The small devices on the equipment that use GIS (geographic information system) are what makes precision agriculture what it is; the GIS system can be thought of as the “brain”. To be able to use precision agriculture, the equipment needs to be wired with the right technology and data systems. More tools include Variable rate technology (VRT), Global positioning system, Geographical information system, Grid sampling, and remote sensors.[20]\n\n### Geolocating\nGeolocating a field enables the farmer to overlay information gathered from the analysis of soils and residual nitrogen, and information on previous crops and soil resistivity. Geolocation is done in two ways\n\n### Variables\nIntra and inter-field variability may result from a number of factors. These include climatic conditions (hail, drought, rain, etc.), soils (texture, depth, nitrogen levels), cropping practices (no-till farming), weeds, and disease.\nPermanent indicators—chiefly soil indicators—provide farmers with information about the main environmental constants.\nPoint indicators allow them to track a crop's status, i.e., to see whether diseases are developing, if the crop is suffering from water stress, nitrogen stress, or lodging, whether it has been damaged by ice, and so on.\nThis information may come from weather stations and other sensors (soil electrical resistivity, detection with the naked eye, satellite imagery, etc.).\nSoil resistivity measurements combined with soil analysis make it possible to measure moisture content. Soil resistivity is also a relatively simple and cheap measurement.[21]\n\n### Strategies\nUsing soil maps, farmers can pursue two strategies to adjust field inputs: Decisions may be based on decision-support models (crop simulation models and recommendation models) based on big data, but in the final analysis it is up to the farmer to decide in terms of business value and impacts on the environment- a role being taken over by artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on machine learning and artificial neural networks. It is important to realize why PA technology is or is not adopted, \"for PA technology adoption to occur the farmer has to perceive the technology as useful and easy to use. It might be insufficient to have positive outside data on the economic benefits of PA technology as perceptions of farmers have to reflect these economic considerations.\"[25]\n\n### Implementing Practices\nNew information and communication technologies make field-level crop management more operational and easier to achieve for farmers.\nApplication of crop management decisions calls for agricultural equipment that supports variable-rate technology (VRT), for example varying seed density along with the variable-rate application (VRA) of nitrogen and phytosanitary products.[26] Precision agriculture uses technology on agricultural equipment (e.g. tractors, sprayers, harvesters, etc.):\n\n### Usage Around The World\nThe concept of precision agriculture first emerged in the United States in the early 1980s. In 1985, researchers at the University of Minnesota varied lime inputs in crop fields. It was also at this time that the practice of grid sampling appeared (applying a fixed grid of one sample per hectare). Towards the end of the 1980s, this technique was used to derive the first input recommendation maps for fertilizers and pH corrections. The use of yield sensors developed from new technologies, combined with the advent of GPS receivers, has been gaining ground ever since. Today, such systems cover several million hectares. In the American Midwest (US), it is associated not with sustainable agriculture but with mainstream farmers who are trying to maximize profits by spending money only in areas that require fertilizer. This practice allows the farmer to vary the rate of fertilizer across the field according to the need identified by GPS guided Grid or Zone Sampling. Fertilizer that would have been spread in areas that do not need it can be placed in areas in need, thereby optimizing its use. Around the world, precision agriculture developed at a varying pace. Precursor nations were the United States, Canada and Australia. In Europe, the United Kingdom was the first to go down this path, followed closely by France, where it first appeared in 1997–1998. In Latin America the leading country is Argentina, where it was introduced in the middle 1990s with the support of the National Agricultural Technology Institute. Brazil established a state-owned enterprise, Embrapa, to research and develop sustainable agriculture. The development of GPS and variable-rate spreading techniques helped to anchor precision farming[27] management practices. Today, less than 10% of France's farmers are equipped with variable-rate systems. Uptake of GPS is more widespread, but this hasn't stopped them using precision agriculture services, which supplies field-level recommendation maps.[28] While digital technologies can transform the landscape of agricultural machinery, making mechanization both more precise and more accessible, non-mechanized production is still dominant in many low- and middle-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.[5][29] Research on precision agriculture for non-mechanized production is increasing and so is its adoption.[30][31][32] Examples include the AgroCares hand-held soil scanner, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) services (also known as drones), and GNSS to map field boundaries and establish land tenure.[33] However, it is not clear how many agricultural producers actually use digital technologies.[33][34] Precision livestock farming supports farmers in real-time by continuously monitoring and controlling animal productivity, environmental impacts, and health and welfare parameters.[35] Sensors attached to animals or to barn equipment operate climate control and monitor animals’ health status, movement and needs. For example, cows can be tagged with the electronic identification (EID) that allows a milking robot to access a database of udder coordinates for specific cows.[36] Global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years,[37] but adoption is likely mostly in Northern Europe,[38] and likely a",

    "content": "### History\nThe earliest published work on growing terrestrial plants without soil was the 1627 book Sylva Sylvarum or 'A Natural History' by Francis Bacon, printed a year after his death. As a result of his work, water culture became a popular research technique. In 1699, John Woodward published his water culture experiments with spearmint. He found that plants in less-pure water sources grew better than plants in distilled water.[13] By 1842, a list of nine elements believed to be essential for plant growth had been compiled, and the discoveries of German botanists Julius von Sachs and Wilhelm Knop, in the years 1859–1875, resulted in a development of the technique of soilless cultivation.[14] To quote von Sachs directly: \"In the year 1860, I published the results of experiments which demonstrated that land plants are capable of absorbing their nutritive matters out of watery solutions, without the aid of soil, and that it is possible in this way not only to maintain plants alive and growing for a long time, as had long been known, but also to bring about a vigorous increase of their organic substance, and even the production of seed capable of germination.\"[15] Growth of terrestrial plants without soil in mineral nutrient solutions was later called \"solution culture\" in reference to \"soil culture\". It quickly became a standard research and teaching technique in the 19th and 20th centuries and is still widely used in plant nutrition science.[16] Around the 1930s plant nutritionists investigated diseases of certain plants, and thereby, observed symptoms related to existing soil conditions such as salinity or nutrient deficiency. In this context, water culture experiments were undertaken with the hope of delivering similar symptoms under controlled laboratory conditions.[17] This approach forced by Dennis Robert Hoagland led to innovative model systems (e.g., green algae Nitella) and standardized nutrient recipes playing an increasingly important role in modern plant physiology.[18] In 1929, William Frederick Gericke of the University of California at Berkeley began publicly promoting that the principles of solution culture be used for agricultural crop production.[19][20][21] He first termed this cultivation method \"aquiculture\" created in analogy to \"agriculture\" but later found that the cognate term aquaculture was already applied to culture of aquatic organisms. Gericke created a sensation by growing tomato vines twenty-five feet (7.6 metres) high in his backyard in mineral nutrient solutions rather than soil.[22] He then introduced the term Hydroponics, water culture, in 1937, proposed to him by W. A. Setchell, a phycologist with an extensive education in the classics.[23][24] Hydroponics is derived from neologism υδρωπονικά (derived from Greek ύδωρ=water and πονέω=cultivate), constructed in analogy to γεωπονικά (derived from Greek γαία=earth and πονέω=cultivate),[25] geoponica, that which concerns agriculture, replacing, γεω-, earth, with ὑδρο-, water.[14] Despite initial successes, however, Gericke realized that the time was not yet ripe for the general technical application and commercial use of hydroponics for producing crops.[26] He also wanted to make sure all aspects of hydroponic cultivation were researched and tested before making any of the specifics available to the public.[27] Reports of Gericke's work and his claims that hydroponics would revolutionize plant agriculture prompted a huge number of requests for further information. Gericke had been denied use of the university's greenhouses for his experiments due to the administration's skepticism, and when the university tried to compel him to release his preliminary nutrient recipes developed at home, he requested greenhouse space and time to improve them using appropriate research facilities. While he was eventually provided greenhouse space, the university assigned Hoagland and Arnon to re-evaluate Gericke's claims and show his formula held no benefit over soil grown plant yields, a view held by Hoagland. Because of these irreconcilable conflicts, Gericke left his academic position in 1937 in a climate that was politically unfavorable and continued his research independently in his greenhouse. In 1940, Gericke, whose work is considered to be the basis for all forms of hydroponic growing, published the book, Complete Guide to Soilless Gardening. Therein, for the first time, he published his basic formulas involving the macro- and micronutrient salts for hydroponically grown plants.[28] As a result of research of Gericke's claims by order of the Director of the California Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of California, Claude Hutchison, Dennis Hoagland and Daniel Arnon wrote a classic 1938 agricultural bulletin, The Water Culture Method for Growing Plants Without Soil, one of the most important works on solution culture ever, which made the claim that hydroponic crop yields were no better than crop yields obtained with good-quality soils.[29] Ultimately, crop yields would be limited by factors other than mineral nutrients, especially light and aeration of the culture medium.[30] However, in the introduction to his landmark book on soilless cultivation, published two years later, Gericke pointed out that the results published by Hoagland and Arnon in comparing the yields of experimental plants in sand, soil and solution cultures, were based on several systemic errors (\"...these experimenters have made the mistake of limiting the productive capacity of hydroponics to that of soil. Comparison can be only by growing as great a number of plants in each case as the fertility of the culture medium can support.\").[28] For example, the Hoagland and Arnon study did not adequately appreciate that hydroponics has other key benefits compared to soil culture including the fact that the roots of the plant have constant access to oxygen and that the plants have access to as much or as little water and nutrients as they need.[28][31] This is important as one of the most common errors when cultivating plants is over- and underwatering; hydroponics prevents this from occurring as large amounts of water, which may drown root systems in soil, can be made available to the plant in hydroponics, and any water not used, is drained away, recirculated, or actively aerated, eliminating anoxic conditions in the root area. In soil, a grower needs to be very experienced to know exactly how much water to feed the plant. Too much and the plant will be unable to access oxygen because air in the soil pores is displaced, which can lead to root rot; too little and the plant will undergo water stress or lose the ability to absorb nutrients, which are typically moved into the roots while dissolved, leading to nutrient deficiency symptoms such as chlorosis or fertilizer burn. Eventually, Gericke's advanced ideas led to the implementation of hydroponics into commercial agriculture while Hoagland's views and helpful support by the University prompted Hoagland and his associates to develop several new formulas (recipes) for mineral nutrient solutions, universally known as Hoagland solution.[32] One of the earliest successes of hydroponics occurred on Wake Island, a rocky atoll in the Pacific Ocean used as a refueling stop for Pan American Airlines. Hydroponics was used there in the 1930s to grow vegetables for the passengers. Hydroponics was a necessity on Wake Island because there was no soil, and it was prohibitively expensive to airlift in fresh vegetables.[33] From 1943 to 1946, Daniel I. Arnon served as a major in the United States Army and used his prior expertise with plant nutrition to feed troops stationed on barren Ponape Island in the western Pacific by growing crops in gravel and nutrient-rich water because there was no arable land available.[34] In the 1960s, Allen Cooper of England developed the nutrient film technique.[35] The Land Pavilion at Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center opened in 1982 ",

    "title": "Vertical Farming",
    "content": "### Types\nThe term \"vertical farming\" was coined by Gilbert Ellis Bailey in 1915 in his book Vertical Farming. His use of the term differs from the current meaning—he wrote about farming with a special interest in soil origin, its nutrient content and the view of plant life as \"vertical\" life forms, specifically relating to their underground root structures.[18] Modern usage of the term \"vertical farming\" usually refers to growing plants in layers, whether in a multistorey skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container.[citation needed]\n\n### Mixed-Use Skyscrapers\nMixed-use skyscrapers were proposed and built by architect Ken Yeang. Yeang proposes that instead of hermetically sealed mass-produced agriculture, plant life should be cultivated within open air, mixed-use skyscrapers for climate control and consumption. This version of vertical farming is based upon personal or community use rather than the wholesale production and distribution that aspires to feed an entire city.[19]\n\n### Despommier'S Skyscrapers\nEcologist Dickson Despommier argues that vertical farming is legitimate for environmental reasons. He claims that the cultivation of plant life within skyscrapers will require less embodied energy and produce less pollution than some methods of producing plant life on natural landscapes. By shifting to vertical farms, Despommier believes that farmland will return to its natural state (i.e., forests), which would help reverse the effects of climate change. He moreover claims that natural landscapes are too toxic for natural agricultural production. Vertical farming would remove some of the parasitic risks associated with farming.[20] Despommier's concept of the vertical farm emerged in 1999 at Columbia University. It promotes the mass cultivation of plant life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers.[21]\n\n### Stackable Shipping Containers\nSeveral companies have developed stacking recycled shipping containers in urban settings. The shipping containers serve as standardized, modular environmental chambers for growing. By stacking the shipping containers, higher density in terms of produce yield/square foot is possible. But, the stacked containers pose the challenge of how to effectively and affordably access the stacked levels. Freight Farms produced the \"Greenery\" that is a complete system outfitted with vertical hydroponics, LED lighting and climate controls built within a 12 m × 2.4 m shipping container.[22]  Podponics built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked \"growpods\", but reportedly went bankrupt in May 2016.[23] In 2017, TerraFarms offered a system of 40-foot shipping containers, which included computer vision integrated with an artificial neural network to monitor the plants;[24] and were remotely monitored. It was claimed that the TerraFarm system \"has achieved cost parity with traditional, outdoor farming\"[25] with each unit producing the equivalent of \"three to five acres [one to two hectares] of farmland\", using 97% less water[26] through water recapture and harvesting the evaporated water through the air conditioning.[27]\n\n### In Abandoned Mine Shafts\nVertical farming in abandoned mine shafts is termed \"deep farming\", and is proposed to take advantage of consistent underground temperatures and locations near or in urban areas. It would also be able to use nearby groundwater, thereby reducing the cost of providing water to the farm.[28]\n\n### Technology\nLighting can be natural or via LEDs. As of 2018 commercial LEDs were about 28% efficient,[needs update] which keeps the cost of produce high and prevents vertical farms from competing in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant.[29] Energy costs can be reduced because full-spectrum white light is not required. Instead, red and blue or purple light can be generated with less electricity.[citation needed]\n\n### History\nOne of the earliest drawings of a tall building that cultivates food was published in Life Magazine in 2009.[30] The reproduced drawings feature vertically stacked homesteads set amidst a farming landscape. This proposal can be seen in Rem Koolhaas's Delirious New York.  Koolhaas wrote that this theorem is 'The Skyscraper as Utopian device for the production of unlimited numbers of virgin sites on a metropolitan location'.[31]\n\n### Hydroponicum\nEarly architectural proposals that contribute to VF include Le Corbusier's Immeubles-Villas (1922) and SITE's Highrise of Homes (1972).[32]  SITE's Highrise of Homes is a near revival of the 1909 Life Magazine Theorem.[33] Built examples of tower hydroponicums are documented in The Glass House by John Hix. Images of the vertical farms at the School of Gardeners in Langenlois, Austria, and the glass tower at the Vienna International Horticulture Exhibition (1964) show that vertical farms existed.[34] The technological precedents that make vertical farming possible can be traced back to horticultural history through the development of greenhouse and hydroponic technology. Early hydroponicums integrated hydroponic technology into building systems. These horticultural building systems evolved from greenhouse technology.  The British Interplanetary Society developed a hydroponicum for lunar conditions, while other building prototypes were developed during the early days of space exploration. The Armenian tower hydroponicums are the first built examples of a vertical farm, and are documented in Sholto Douglas' Hydroponics: The Bengal System, first published in 1951 with data from the then-East Pakistan, today's Bangladesh, and the Indian state of West Bengal.[35][36] Later precursors that have been published, or built, are Ken Yeang's Bioclimatic Skyscraper (Menara Mesiniaga, built 1992); MVRDV's PigCity, 2000; MVRDV's Meta City/ Datatown (1998–2000); Pich-Aguilera's Garden Towers (2001).[32] Ken Yeang is perhaps the most widely known architect who has promoted the idea of the 'mixed-use' Bioclimatic Skyscraper which combines living units and food production.[citation needed]\n\n### Vertical Farm\nDickson Despommier is a professor of environmental health sciences and microbiology. He reopened the topic of VF in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. He speculated that a 30-floor farm on one city block could provide food for 50,000 people including vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat, explaining that hydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; while the lower floors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plant waste. Although many of Despommier's suggestions have been challenged from an environmental science and engineering point of view, Despommier successfully popularized his assertion that food production can be transformed. Critics claimed that the additional energy needed for artificial lighting, heating and other operations would outweigh the benefit of the building's close proximity to the areas of consumption.[37][38] Despommier originally challenged his class to feed the entire population of Manhattan (about 2,000,000 people) using only 5 hectares (13 acres) of rooftop gardens. The class calculated that rooftop gardening methods could feed only 2% of the population. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier made an off-the-cuff suggestion of growing plants indoors, vertically. By 2001 the first outline of a vertical farm was introduced. In an interview Despommier described how vertical farms would function: Each floor will have its own watering and nutrient monitoring systems. There will be sensors for every single plant that tracks how much and what kinds of nutrients the plant has absorbed. You'll even have systems to monitor plant diseases by employing DNA chip technologies that detect the presence of plant pathogens by simply sampling the air and using snippets from various viral and bacterial infections. It's very easy to do.\nMoreover, a gas chromatograph will tell us when to pick the plant by analyzing which flavenoids the produce contains. These flavonoids are what gives the f",

    "title": "Aquaponics",
    "content": "### System Types\nGenerally, aquaponics systems are classified into three types, namely media-based bed, floating raft, and nutrient film technique. Among them, the media-based system is believed to be more efficient in the utilization of nitrogen since it provides more volume-to-surface area ratio for the microbes than the other two types.[6]\n\n### Deep Water Culture\nThe deep water culture system consists of substantial troughs containing perforated floating rafts, into which net plant pots are placed. Within the system, these plant pots are typically filled with media, such as rockwool, coco, or pumice, that serve to support the roots, which are subsequently and continuously submerged within the water tank.[7]\n\n### Nutrient Film Technique\nThe nutrient film technique consists of narrow channels of perforated squared pipes where the roots are partially immersed in a thin layer of streaming water.[7]\n\n### Media-Based Grow Bed\nA media-based grow bed is a hydroponic system type that utilizes a trough filled with an inert material to assist plant roots and accommodate beneficial microbes. Water is usually delivered in a flooding and draining cycle (ebb and flow), delivering nutrients and oxygen to the plants.[7] By utilizing gravel or sand as plant supporting medium, solids are captured and the medium has enough surface area for fixed-film nitrification. The ability to combine biofiltration and hydroponics allows for aquaponic system, in many cases, to eliminate the need for an expensive, separate biofilter.[8] A media‐based system is believed to be more efficient in the utilization of nitrogen since it provides more volume‐to‐surface area ratio for the microbes than deep-water raft or nutrient film technique.[6]\n\n### History\nAquaponics has ancient roots, although there is some debate on its first occurrence.\n\n### Early Beginnings: Aztecs And Chinese (6Th Century - 13Th Century)\nAquaponics has been said to have evolved from relatively ancient agriculture practices associated with integrating fish culture with plant production, especially those developed within the South East Asian, flooded rice paddy farming context and South American Chinampa, floating island, agriculture practices (Komives and Junge 2015). In reality, historically, fish were rarely actively added to rice paddy fields until the nineteenth century (Halwart and Gupta 2004) and were present in very low densities which would not contribute to any substantial nutritive assistance to the plants. Chinampas were traditionally built on lakes in Mexico where nutrient advantages may have been supplied via the eutrophic or semi-eutrophic lake sediments rather than directly from any designed or actively integrated fish production system (Morehart 2016; Baquedano 1993).[9]\n\n### Modern Developments (1930S-Present)\nAn integrated system of aquaculture and agriculture where fish are grown in rice paddies has been employed in the North Kerian area of Perak in Peninsular Malaysia since the 1930's. Several rice-fish systems are also reported to have a long history in Indonesia.[19] In 1965, Sengbusch and his colleagues were the first to attempt raising common carp, a type of fish, in tanks with a system that recirculated water and used activated sludge to treat the water. A few years later, in 1971, Scherb and Braun provided more detailed studies on using a similar system to raise rainbow trout. At the South Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station in Clemson, researchers Loyacano and Grosvenor (1973) tried to clean fish ponds with channel catfish by using water chestnut plants to absorb the extra nutrients.[20] In 1977, German scientist Ludwig C.A. Naegel contributed to the field of aquaponics with his publication 'Combined Production of Fish and Plants in Recirculating Water.' The work presented experiments on the co-cultivation of tilapia and tomatoes, showcasing the practicality of a recirculating system that supports both fish and plant production.[20] This research is among the efforts by a global community of researchers to develop modern aquaponics systems. Balarin and Haller conducted studies on the thermal dynamics of aquaponic systems, examining the effects of varying water temperatures on the growth rates of fish and plants.[22] In the development of biofiltration techniques within aquaponics, Muir, Paller, and Lewis introduced reciprocating biofilters (RBFs). These biofilters enhanced the efficiency of nutrient uptake by plants and reduced the accumulation of harmful metabolites in the water[citation needed]. Watten and Busch contributed to the understanding of nutrient dynamics in aquaponic systems. Their studies on the integration of vascular plants into recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) demonstrated how plants could effectively extract excess nutrients from the water.[23] Prior to the technological advances of the 1980s, most attempts to integrate hydroponics and aquaculture had limited success.[24] Many of the modern developments and discoveries of aquaponics are generally attributed to the New Alchemy Institute and North Carolina State University.[25][6]\n\n### New Alchemy Institute\nIn 1969, John and Nancy Todd and William McLarney founded the New Alchemy Institute and built a prototype replica of the Aztec's aquaponic system (with some modifications) to provide shelter, vegetables, and fish throughout the year.[6] In 1984, Ronald Zweig of the New Alchemy Institute developed a system he called the 'hydroponic aquaculture pond,' also referred to as a 'hydroponic solar pond.' This system integrated a floating hydroponic component within the institute's existing solar pond[19] these floating raft systems are the foundation for what became later known as deep water culture.\n\n### North Carolina State University\nMark McMurtry and others at North Carolina State University conceptualized the Integrated Aqua-Vegeculture System. This system, which integrates aquaculture with sand-based grow beds,[16] represents one of the earliest instances of a closed-loop aquaponic system. McMurtry's research and findings confirmed much of the foundational science underlying aquaponics, demonstrating that the system operates effectively.[26]\n\n### University Of The Virgin Islands\nIn 1979, James Rakocy and his colleagues at the University of the Virgin Islands began experimenting with media beds in aquaponics. Initially, the system utilized a gravel bed for plant growth, alongside a conical filter settling tank to collect larger solid waste, and a separate tank for housing the fish.[27] In 1986, they started to test the use of floating rafts constructed from polystyrene.[21] By 1997, Rakocy's research had led to the adoption of deep water culture hydroponic grow beds in large-scale aquaponic systems.[26]\n\n### Other Systems\nOther institutes focused their research on systems known as \"ebb and flow,\" or \"flood and drain\" systems. These systems utilize coarse media like gravel or expanded clay, with bell siphons facilitating the irrigation cycle[28] These systems are sometimes referred to as \"Speraneo Systems,\" as they were named after Tom and Paula Speraneo, who created and sold an instructional manual in the 1990s[29] and adopted the North Carolina State University system to invent a full-size commercial-scale solar greenhouse.[30] The first aquaponics research in Canada began with a small system integrated into aquaculture research at a station in Lethbridge, Alberta. In the 1990s, commercial aquaponics setups increased, focusing on high-value crops like trout and lettuce. A key development occurred in Brooks, Alberta, where Dr. Nick Savidov and his team from Lethbridge College's Aquaculture Centre of Excellence (ACE) conducted extensive research. They found rapid root growth in aquaponics systems and effective methods for closing the solid-waste loop. They also discovered that these systems could efficiently operate at low pH levels, which benefits plant growth but is typically unfavorable for fish. This researc",

    "title": "Aeroponics",
    "content": "### Methods\nThe fundamental principle of aeroponic growing entails suspending plants in a closed or semi-closed environment whilst spraying their dangling roots and lower stems with a nutrient-rich water solution in an atomized or sprayed form.[2] The upper portion of the plant, including the leaves and crown, referred to as the canopy, extends above. The plant support structure keeps the roots separated. To minimize labor and expenses, closed-cell foam is often compressed around the lower stem and inserted into an opening in the aeroponic chamber. In the case of larger plants, trellising is employed to support the weight of the vegetation and fruits. The goal is to maintain an environment free from pests and diseases, allowing the plants to thrive and grow faster than those cultivated in a growing medium. However, since most aeroponic environments are not completely sealed off from the outside, pests and diseases can still pose a threat. Controlled environments facilitate the advancement of plant development, health, growth, flowering, and fruiting for various plant species and cultivars. Due to the sensitivity of root systems, aeroponics is often combined with conventional hydroponics. This serves as a backup nutrition and water supply in case of any failure in the aeroponic system, acting as an emergency \"crop saver.\" High-pressure aeroponics refers to the method of delivering nutrients to the roots using mist heads with a size range of 20-50 micrometers. This is achieved using a high-pressure diaphragm pump operating at around 80 pounds per square inch (550 kPa).\n\n### Increased Air Exposure\nAir cultures maximize air exposure to facilitate optimal plant growth. The materials and devices that hold and support aeroponically grown plants must be completely free from disease or pathogens. A vital characteristic of a genuine aeroponic culture and apparatus is minimal plant support features. This design allows maximum airflow around the plant by minimizing contact between the plant and the support structure. In long-term aeroponic cultivation, it is crucial to ensure that the root systems are unconstrained, allowing unrestricted growth, root expansion, unhindered access to pure water, adequate air exchange, and disease-free conditions.[2][failed verification]\n\n### Benefits Of Oxygen In The Root Zone\nAdequate oxygen (O2) availability in the rhizosphere (root zone) is essential for promoting healthy plant growth. In aeroponics, where plants are grown in an environment of air and micro-droplets of water, almost any plant can thrive and reach maturity with an abundant supply of oxygen, water, and nutrients. Some growers prefer aeroponic systems over other hydroponic methods, since the increased aeration of the nutrient solution provides greater oxygenation to the plant roots, stimulating growth and aiding in the prevention of pathogen formation.[2][failed verification] Clean air plays a crucial role in purifying the environment for plants in aeroponics. Unrestricted access to air is necessary for natural plant growth and successful physiological development. If the support structure restricts the plant's natural growth, it can increase the risk of plant damage and subsequent disease formation.[2][failed verification] Researchers have utilized aeroponics to study the impact of gas composition in the root zone on plant performance. Soffer and Burger (1988) conducted a study on the effects of dissolved oxygen concentrations in a system they termed \"aero-hydroponics,\" which involved a 3-tier hydro and aero system with distinct zones within the root area. Their results indicated that dissolved oxygen is crucial for root formation. Additionally, they found that in the misted section, where nutrient mist was provided, the number and length of roots were consistently greater compared to the submerged or un-misted sections. Even at the lowest oxygen concentration tested, the misted section demonstrated successful root development.[2][failed verification]\n\n### Other Benefits Of Air (Co2)\nAeroponics also entails the management of CO2 levels in the system's air, which subsequently impacts the rate of photosynthesis in plants. Utilizing artificial lights for growth offers advantages such as increased growth rates and enhanced reliability compared to solar lighting. This lighting method can be effectively combined with aeroponics to optimize plant growth.[2][failed verification]\n\n### Disease-Free Cultivation\nAeroponics offers the advantage of limiting disease transmission since it reduces plant-to-plant contact, and each spray pulse can be kept sterile. In contrast, diseases can easily spread throughout soil, aggregate, or other growing media, affecting multiple plants. Traditional greenhouses often require sterilization of solid media after each crop, and sometimes these media are simply discarded and replaced with fresh, sterile ones.[2][failed verification] One significant benefit of aeroponic technology is the ability to quickly remove a diseased plant from the plant support structure without disrupting or infecting other plants, thanks to the isolated nature of the system. Due to the disease-free environment unique to aeroponics, many plants can be grown at higher densities (plants per square meter) compared to more traditional cultivation methods like hydroponics, soil, and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT). Commercial aeroponic systems incorporate hardware features that accommodate the expanding root systems of crops. Researchers have highlighted aeroponics as a valuable, simple, and rapid method for preliminary screening of genotypes for resistance to specific seedling blights or root rots.[3] The isolating nature of aeroponic systems enables researchers to avoid complications encountered when studying these infections in soil cultures.\n\n### Water And Nutrient Hydro-Atomization\nAeroponic equipment employs sprayers, misters, foggers, or other devices to create a fine mist of solution for delivering nutrients to plant roots. Aeroponic systems are typically closed-looped systems designed to provide macro and micro-environments that sustain reliable and consistent air cultures. Several inventions have been developed to facilitate aeroponic spraying and misting. The size of the water droplet is critical for root development in an aeroponic environment. In commercial applications, a 360° hydro-atomizing spray is used, which utilizes air pressure misting to cover large areas of roots. A variation of the mist technique, known as fogponics, utilizes ultrasonic foggers to mist nutrient solutions in low-pressure aeroponic devices. Water droplet size plays a vital role in maintaining aeroponic growth. Water droplets that are too large can limit the availability of oxygen to the root system. Conversely, excessively fine water droplets generated by ultrasonic misters can lead to excessive root hair growth without developing a lateral root system necessary for sustained growth in an aeroponic system.[2][failed verification] Mineralization of ultrasonic transducers requires maintenance and presents a potential risk of component failure. This is also a drawback of metal spray jets and misters. Restricted access to water can cause plants to lose turgidity and wilt.\n\n### Advanced Materials\nNASA has provided funding for research and development of new advanced materials aimed at improving the reliability and reducing maintenance in aeroponics. It has been determined that a high-pressure hydro-atomized mist with micro-droplets ranging from 5 to 50 micrometers is necessary for sustained aeroponic growth. To ensure long-term growth, the mist system must possess significant pressure to effectively penetrate the dense root system(s). Achieving repeatability is crucial in aeroponics, and this includes maintaining the appropriate hydro-atomized droplet size. The degradation of the spray caused by mineralization of mist heads hampers the delivery of the water nutrient solution, resulting in a",

    "content": "### History\nAgricultural development in Britain between the 16th century and the mid-19th century saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output. This in turn contributed to unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped enable the Industrial Revolution. Historians cited enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation, and selective breeding as the most important innovations.[6] Industrial agriculture arose in the Industrial Revolution. By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks, and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages.[7][page needed] The first phase involved a continuing process of mechanization. Horse-drawn machinery such as the McCormick reaper revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the cotton gin reduced the cost of processing. During this same period, farmers began to use steam-powered threshers and tractors.[8][9][10] In 1892, the first gasoline-powered tractor was successfully developed, and in 1923, the International Harvester Farmall tractor became the first all-purpose tractor, marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines. Mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters, and other equipment were then developed, further revolutionizing agriculture.[11] These inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms.[12] The identification of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers, further increasing crop yields. In 1909, the Haber-Bosch method to synthesize ammonium nitrate was first demonstrated. NPK fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture, due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction, soil erosion, and declines in overall soil fertility, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply.[13] The discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition, in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors, reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements.[14] Following World War II synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly.[15] The discovery of antibiotics and vaccines facilitated raising livestock by reducing diseases.[16][17] Developments in logistics and refrigeration as well as processing technology made long-distance distribution feasible. Integrated pest management is the modern method to minimize pesticide use to more sustainable levels.[18][19] There are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture, and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides, which has given rise to the organic movement[20] and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming, as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology.\n\n### Livestock\nPasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems. It is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation, a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing, poor nutrient management, and lack of soil conservation.[21] This degradation leads to poor pasture soils with decreased fertility and water availability and increased rates of erosion, compaction, and acidification.[22] Degraded pastures have significantly lower productivity and higher carbon footprints compared to intensified pastures.[23][24][25][26][27] Management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation, soil scarification, and the application of lime, fertilizers, and pesticides. Depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system, more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace invasive and under-productive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the soil and climate conditions of the region.[21] These intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter, resulting in more productive, carbon-efficient livestock systems.[25][26][27] Another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems, which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework.[28] Correctly performed, such production systems are able to create synergies potentially providing benefits to pastures through optimal plant usage, improved feed and fattening rates, increased soil fertility and quality, intensified nutrient cycling, integrated pest control, and improved biodiversity.[21][28] The introduction of certain legume crops to pastures can increase carbon accumulation and nitrogen fixation in soils, while their digestibility helps animal fattening and reduces methane emissions from enteric fermentation.[21][25] ICLF systems yield beef cattle productivity up to ten times that of degraded pastures; additional crop production from maize, sorghum, and soybean harvests; and greatly reduced greenhouse gas balances due to forest carbon sequestration.[22] In the Twelve Aprils grazing program for dairy production, developed by the USDA-SARE, forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture.[29] Rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh, rested grazing areas (sometimes called paddocks) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. It can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other animals. The herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover. Resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves, rebuild shoot systems, and deepen root systems, resulting in long-term maximum biomass production.[4][5][30][31] Pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements, but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems. Parasites are also left behind to die off, minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers. With the increased productivity of rotational systems, the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems. Farmers can therefore increase stocking rates.[4][32] Intensive livestock farming or \"factory farming\", is the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density.[33][34][35][36][37] \"Concentrated animal feeding operations\" (CAFO), or \"intensive livestock operations\", can hold large numbers (some up to hundreds of thousands) of cows, hogs, turkeys, or chickens, often indoors. The essence of such farms is the concentration of livestock in a given space. The aim is to provide maximum output at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest level of food safety.[38] The term is often used pejoratively.[39] CAFOs have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide, both in terms of total food produced and efficiency. Food and water is delivered to the animals, and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents, vitamin supplements, and growth hormones are often employed. Growth hormones are not used on chickens nor on any animal in the European Union. Undesirable behaviors often related to the stress of confinement led to a search for docile breeds (e.g., with natural dominant behaviors bred out), physical restraints to stop interaction, such as individual cages for chickens, or physical modification such as the debeaking of chickens to reduce the harm of fighting.[40][41] The CAFO designation resulted from the 1972 U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which was enacted to protect and restore lakes and rivers t",

    "content": "### Systems\nExtensive farming most commonly means raising sheep and cattle in areas with low agricultural productivity, but includes large-scale growing of wheat, barley, cooking oils and other grain crops in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, yields per hectare are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean yields per unit of labor are high. Nomadic herding is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional rainfalls.\n\n### Geography\nExtensive farming is found in the mid-latitude sections of most continents, as well as in desert regions where water for cropping is not available. The nature of extensive farming means it requires less rainfall than intensive farming. The farm is usually large in comparison with the numbers working and money spent on it. In 1957, most parts of Western Australia had pastures so poor that only one sheep to the square mile could be supported.[1] Just as the demand has led to the basic division of cropping and pastoral activities, these areas can also be subdivided depending on the region's rainfall, vegetation type and agricultural activity within the area and the many other parentheses related to this data.\n\n### Advantages\nExtensive farming has a number of advantages over intensive farming:\n\n### Disadvantages\nExtensive farming can have the following problems:[3] Extensive farming was once thought to produce more methane and nitrous oxide per kg of milk than intensive farming.[4] \nOne study estimated that the carbon \"footprint\" per billion kg (2.2 billion lb.) of milk produced in 2007 was 37 percent that of equivalent milk production in 1944.[5] However, a more recent study by Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement found that extensive livestock systems impact the environment less than intensive systems.[6]",
