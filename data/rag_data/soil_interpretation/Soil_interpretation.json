(B) The least stable mineral (olivine) has independent tetrahedron and the silicon tetrahedra are held together by forming bonds with easily hydrolysable magnesium or oxidizable iron. (C) In quartz, one of the least stable minerals, there is a three-dimensional network of silicon tetrahedral and all the oxygen atoms are shared with the adjacent tetrahedra.
