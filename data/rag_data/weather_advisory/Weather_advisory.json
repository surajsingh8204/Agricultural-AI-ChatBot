(2) The depletion of this protective layer leads to an increase in UV radiation at the Earth's surface, which can have detrimental effects on human health, causing skin cancer and cataracts, and impacting ecosystems, including harm to marine life and terrestrial vegetation. (3) However, continued vigilance is essential to ensure a full recovery and the long-term protection of the ozone layer. (4) Ozone depletion refers to the significant reduction of the ozone layer in the Earth's stratosphere, primarily caused by the release of human-made chemicals known as ozone- depleting substances (ODS), such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. (5) The ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing the majority of harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.
